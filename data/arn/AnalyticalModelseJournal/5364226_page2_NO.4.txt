Abstract

This paper examines how stock price informativeness affects the effectiveness of price-based managerial compensation. Stock prices fluctuate with publicly observed macroeconomic shocks and impound private signals of managerial performance through information-based trading. Because sequentially optimal contracts overly exploit prices as forward-looking performance benchmarks, greater price informativeness can discourage long-tenure managers from pursuing long-term value creation. For managers bound to long-term employment, renegotiable contracts based solely on terminal cash flows can tie pay to internal interim forecasts, potentially outperforming rigid contracts based on both stock prices and cash flows. The study also finds that, depending on the composition of uncertainty in long-term firm fundamentals, managerial incentives can strengthen with firm-specific risk, and a strictly intermediate level of stock-price informativeness can be optimal.

Keywords: Noise Trading, Incentives, Dynamic Contracting, Limited Commitment

JEL Classification: D86, G30, J30, M12
