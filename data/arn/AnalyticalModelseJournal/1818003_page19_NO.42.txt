The paper provides analysis of the reconciliation of risk-adjusted performance measure (RAPM) of the Bank as a whole with that of its business units by analyzing the funds transfer pricing (FTP) and capital allocation frameworks. The analysis yields explicit expressions for equity credit rates used in risk-adjusted performance measures. As a by-product it derives the transfer pricing rate for risk capital.

Keywords: Risk-adjusted performance measures, funds transfer pricing, risk capital, equity credit rate
