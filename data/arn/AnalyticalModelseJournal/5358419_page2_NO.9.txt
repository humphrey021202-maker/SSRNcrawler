Abstract

This paper presents a theoretical model examining product market competition between two firms in an environment where buyers and investors exhibit heterogeneous sensitivities to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) practices. I analyze two distinct regimes of corporate sustainability transparency: an opaque regime and a fully transparent regime. Increased transparency does not necessarily enhance social welfare, as total transparency can lead to strategic market segmentation and higher aggregate negative externalities. Further, the incremental profit and market value attributable to sustainability nay be lower for the "green" firm compared to the "brown" firm. Empirical tests using the 2017 Thomson Reuters Asset 4 ESG rating expansion confirm the theoretical prediction, highlighting implications for empirical studies evaluating the impact of ESG transparency on firm value. The analysis highlights how competitive effects can spill over to untreated or brown firms within the same industry, underscoring the need for caution when selecting control samples in difference-indifferences empirical designs.

Keywords: ESG, Sustainability, Transparency, Welfare, Externality, Surplus, Competition, Product Market
