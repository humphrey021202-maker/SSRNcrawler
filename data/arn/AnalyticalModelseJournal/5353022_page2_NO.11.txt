Abstract

This research introduces a novel theoretical model: the AI-Induced Disclosure Pressure Model, which explains how artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping corporate narrative disclosures in the MD&A section of annual reports. Grounded in agency theory, signaling theory, and information economics, the model identifies three core pressures, exposure, competitive, and reputational, that AI imposes on managers ex ante, transforming AI from a passive reader to an active force in disclosure behavior.By analyzing 108 MD&A sections from 27 of the largest firms in the S&P 100 between 2021 and 2024, the study reveals that positive tone is no longer a reliable indicator of strong performance. Rather, firms increasingly use upbeat language to manage perceptions while strategic truth leaks through uncertainty terms, now the clearest tonal signal of weak fundamentals. This performative optimism is not accidental; it is algorithm-aware.

Keywords: MD&A, Artificial Intelligence, Disclosure Pressure, Narrative Tone, Textual Analysis
