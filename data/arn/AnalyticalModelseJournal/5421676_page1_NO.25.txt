Abstract

Regulatory audits in taxation, healthcare, and labor are not neutral instruments but fundamentally asymmetric games, where the auditee bears 100% of the financial and reputational risk. At the same time, the auditor faces only procedural inefficiencies. This power imbalance, often baked into institutional design and perpetuated by AI systems trained on historically biased data, creates a toxic Nash equilibrium of wasteful over-auditing and defensive over-compliance.

This paper introduces the Lopez Theory of Asymmetric Enforcement (LTAE), a novel game-theoretic framework that diagnoses these systemic flaws, formalized through a practical model: the Lopez Audit Anchor Model (LAAM). LAAM rebalances the audit game through three core mechanisms:

Strategic Memory: Audit anchors document past infractions but decay exponentially over time (), ensuring mistakes are not held in perpetuity.

Dynamic Fairness: Algorithmic forgiveness thresholds reset an entity's risk profile after *n* consecutive clean audits, creating a credible path to redemption.

Transparent AI: Bias-aware Bayesian inference classifies entities based on behavior, not static labels, and all auditor discretion is logged for accountability.

By recalibrating incentives, penalizing auditors for false positives, and rewarding auditees for corrective action, LAAM creates a new Nash equilibrium where fairness becomes the rational choice for both players. The paper includes a full Python implementation, demonstrating how this framework can reduce redundant audits, increase voluntary compliance, and restore trust in enforcement systems. This is more than a theory; it is a practical toolkit for building ethical, effective, and game-aware AI.
