Abstract

This study examines the effect of corporate governance on financial reporting quality in Nigeria using data from 10 quoted companies between 2015 and 2019. Key governance variables include board size, board independence, audit committee independence, director shareholding, and ownership structure. Regression results show positive associations among these governance mechanisms and reporting quality. The study highlights the need for regulators to strengthen ethical practices in corporate governance beyond codes and compliance reporting.
