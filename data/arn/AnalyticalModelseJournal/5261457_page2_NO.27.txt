Abstract

This study examines the emerging trend of Green Human Resources Management (Green HRM) practices in India, exploring how organizations are aligning their human resources strategies with environmental sustainability. As businesses face increasing pressure to adopt eco-friendly practices, Green HRM has become a critical component of corporate social responsibility (CSR) efforts in India. The research delves into various Green HRM initiatives, including sustainable recruitment, green training programs, energy-efficient work practices, and performance management systems that promote environmental goals. It also explores the role of HR professionals in fostering a green culture and encouraging employees to actively participate in sustainability efforts. The study identifies challenges faced by organizations, such as resource constraints and resistance to change, and evaluates the impact of these green practices on organizational performance, employee satisfaction, and environmental outcomes. This research aims to provide valuable insights into the potential benefits and effectiveness of Green HRM in promoting long-term sustainability in Indian organizations.

Keywords: Green HRM, Sustainability, Corporate Social Responsibility, Employee Engagement, Environmental Practices
