Abstract

The increasing demand for corporate transparency has heightened the relevance of environmental disclosure in mitigating information asymmetry between firms and stakeholders. However, the extent to which environmental disclosure influences corporate information asymmetry remains an area of ongoing debate. This study investigates the relationship between environmental disclosure and corporate information asymmetry, addressing the critical research problem of whether enhanced environmental reporting reduces the gap in information accessibility among investors and other stakeholders. The study employs a quantitative research design, utilizing panel data regression analysis on a sample of publicly traded firms. Environmental disclosure is measured using a comprehensive disclosure index, while corporate information asymmetry is proxied by bid-ask spread and analyst forecast dispersion. The findings reveal a significant negative relationship between environmental disclosure and corporate information asymmetry, suggesting that firms with higher environmental disclosure experience lower information asymmetry. This study contributes to the literature by providing empirical evidence on the role of non-financial disclosure in reducing market inefficiencies. The originality of this study lies in its integration of environmental disclosure as a mechanism for improving corporate transparency, offering valuable insights for policymakers, regulators, and investors.
