Abstract

Accounts such as revenues and expenses are nonnegative by convention, making their distributions inherently skewed. Because of this asymmetry, changing the means of these accounts can affect their higher-order moments as well, which in turn alters their informativeness as performance measures. In a parametric multitasking setting, I show that the principal incentivizes not just more effort toward tasks that improve expected outcomes at a lower cost, but toward tasks that naturally improve informativeness. I further show that for a large class of positively-skewed distributions, mean-increasing actions harm informativeness whereas mean-decreasing actions improve it. For example, cost cutting makes expenses more informative, whereas sales growth makes revenues less informative. As a result, the principal incentivizes more cost cutting than revenue growth, even when the marginal cost and productivity of these tasks are the same.

Keywords: Optimal contracting, multitasking, performance measurement, accounting, informativeness

JEL Classification: D86, M41
