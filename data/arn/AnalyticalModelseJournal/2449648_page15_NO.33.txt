Abstract

The audit policy of a tax authority can signal its audit effectiveness. We model this process and show that in limited circumstances an ineffective authority can masquerade as being effective. We show that high maximal penalties imply underreporting of income.

Keywords: Auditing, Signaling, Taxation

JEL Classification: D82, D86, C71
