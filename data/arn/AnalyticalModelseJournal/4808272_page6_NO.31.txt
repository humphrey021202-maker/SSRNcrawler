Abstract

We analyze how borrowers’ capital structure affects their incentives to integrate ESG. Borrowers may pursue socially valuable but financially underperforming projects to reduce expected payments to outside investors. These financial gains increase when the expected payoff of securities held by investors sensitively changes with project profitability. ESG-focused investors may accept financial losses to fund such projects, especially when borrowers have relatively weak social preferences. However, competition among investors endogenously reduces contract sensitivity, undermining ESG goals. When permitted, borrowers issue debt if they place a greater weight on financial returns, offering explanation for the growing trend of debt in green financing.

Keywords: capital structure, ESG, greenwashing, moral hazard, security design

JEL Classification: D82, D86, G32, G38
