Abstract

We develop a design-based theory of calibration committees. Although committees are widely used to mitigate rater bias in subjective performance evaluation, guidance on how to choose their size and standard has been lacking. We model a firm that operates under a uniform (pooling) policy and chooses committee size and a firm-wide standard to manage evaluator favoritism. The model yields four results. First, the effect of committee size on the probability that high effort receives an adverse decision obeys simple shape restrictions: it moves monotonically or displays a single interior peak, but does not switch direction repeatedly. Second, the marginal benefit of adding members is larger under pooling than under type-specific contracts (separation), helping explain why committees are especially valuable where HR policies are uniform. Third, optimal size is finite and characterized by a transparent stopping rule that balances the marginal reduction in expected conflict cost per unit of incentive provision against per-member administrative cost. Fourth, disparities between employee types ultimately decline as committees expand, although they can temporarily widen at intermediate sizes. Taken together, these results add a design-based lens to the calibration literature and outline testable implications for future empirical work.
