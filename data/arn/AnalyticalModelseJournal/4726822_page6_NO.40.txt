Abstract

Firms vary in whether they are transparent with employees about their “fit” within the firm. We build an analytical model to provide an explanation for these variations. The trade-off in our setting is that transparency motivates the “good-fit” employee and demotivates the “bad-fit” employee. Our main result shows that a firm commits to a policy of transparency (secrecy) only when employee success is less (more) informative of effort for a good-fit employee. We also establish that transparency is generally suboptimal when it can induce a good-fit employee to become complacent.

Keywords: Employee-firm fit, transparency, contracting, complacency, output-effort informativeness

JEL Classification: D82, D86, M12, M52
