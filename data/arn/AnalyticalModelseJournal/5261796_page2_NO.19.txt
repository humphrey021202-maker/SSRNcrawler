Abstract

The government has to raise citizens' lifestyle conditions by launching initiatives that quicken economic expansion. Technology, which played a crucial role in the "Digital India Program," was the power that drove Digitalization. India has become one of the nations where the government has started this development program to encourage financial growth and to give new generations jobs. The fundamental goal was to make all services available to each person digitally or through online platforms to facilitate simple and open transactions. The government is putting more money into technology to eradicate bribery and black money from public life. The study contributes to people's understanding of Digitalization and its effects on Indian citizens via its products and services and the extent to which its aims have been met.

Keywords: Digital India, Technology, Sustainable Development Goals, Digitalization
