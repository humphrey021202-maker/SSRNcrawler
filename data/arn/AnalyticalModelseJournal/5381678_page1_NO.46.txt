Abstract

This study investigates key behavioral predictors of trust in AI for accounting and financial decision-making, focusing on AI literacy, technological readiness, perceived usefulness, and ethical awareness. Using structural equation modeling, findings reveal that trust and ethical awareness significantly outweigh traditional factors when cognitive styles are considered. Analytical thinkers, in particular, show greater trust in AI systems when ethical considerations are embedded during design and development stages. Based on these insights, we propose a new theoretical model: AIERA (Artificial Intelligence Ethical Readiness & Adoption). AIERA challenges linear acceptance models by incorporating ethical and cognitive dimensions, offering a more nuanced understanding of AI adoption beyond technical familiarity. The study advances current literature by integrating cognitive-behavioral theory with technology acceptance frameworks, moving beyond utilitarian models like TAM. These findings suggest a shift toward AI adoption that is iterative, ethically grounded, and personalized. Implications highlight the urgent need for system developers, accounting educators, and policymakers to integrate cognitive and ethical profiling into AI system development, financial education, and governance frameworks to foster responsible and sustainable innovation in intelligent automation.
