Abstract

This study proposes a new model for risk adjustment on default on premium payments in life insurance within the framework of IFRS 17. This methodology integrates the dynamic nature of policyholders’ behaviours and the influence of macroeconomic conditions on default intensity. The researcher employs Random Forest methodology to forecast both default decisions and default amounts in life insurance contracts. Notably, this methodology demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional logistic models, even when considering interactions between features. Particularly suited for volatile economic conditions and stress scenarios, this approach introduces a model that captures the dynamic contagion process of default probability. By accounting for both contagion and correlation among policyholders’ behaviours, the model incorporates an external market-driven jump component influencing default intensity. The model incorporates a log-normal dynamic for forward rates to simulate the trajectories of observable market variables, thereby mimicking the impact of macroeconomic events triggered by changes in economic factors on default intensity.
