Abstract

Performance evaluation with multiple tasks and multiple measures is a favorite indoor sport, replete with coaches, clinics and Monday morning quarterbacks. Here we tweak the familiar LEN setting to exhibit a modest reluctance to feed it an ever increasing supply of measures.

Keywords: Tension relevance, multiple measures

JEL Classification: D80
