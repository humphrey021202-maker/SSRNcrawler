Abstract

Country risk affects audit risk. Hence, audit price in a country, represented by average hourly audit fee, should increase with country-specific audit risk, to compensate auditors’ engagements in riskier countries. We identify a small sample of companies listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange that use auditors in different countries. As these companies must disclose total audit fees and hours of engagement, we compile a novel dataset that includes both fees and hours in 25 different countries for 10 years and compute the average hourly audit fee per country. As the primary measure of country risk, we use the Corruption Perception Index published annually by Transparency International for each country. We expect and find a positive association between perceived corruption and average hourly audit fee normalized by per-capita GDP in the country. We use several alternative measures of country risk with similar results. However, we find no association between audit hours and corruption or other country-specific audit risk measures. Our results suggest that auditors in more corrupt countries are compensated for country-specific audit risk by charging a higher hourly audit rate for their services, but we do not find simultaneously an increase in audit effort in terms of total hours.

Keywords: Audit price, country risk, audit risk, corruption.
