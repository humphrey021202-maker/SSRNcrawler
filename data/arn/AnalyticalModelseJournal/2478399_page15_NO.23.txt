Abstract

Economic Value Added (EVA™) and competing metrics are a leitmotif for management, strategy consultants and Wall Street. Such metrics, the synthesis of M&M proposition III and the notion of residual income, form the scholarly framework on value creation. However, the empirical evidence is poor, e.g. EVA appears less associated to stock returns than earnings, and the available explanations hereof are inconclusive and rather intuitive. A re-examination is warranted and exposes a fundamental flaw: EVA fails to account for market efficiency. A framework that distinguishes between value creation through shareholder returns and value creation through capital budgeting is introduced; resolving the empirical result.

Keywords: Value Creation, EVA, NPV Rule, Market Efficiency, Residual Income, MVC, CVC

JEL Classification: G10, G31, G14, G30
