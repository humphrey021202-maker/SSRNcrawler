Abstract

Blockchain technology is reshaping industries with its emphasis on transparency, security, and decentralization. As this technology becomes integrated into business operations, Certified Public Accountants (CPAs) face new challenges in adapting their practices to meet clients' needs using blockchain. This research examines the preparedness of CPAs, assessing their knowledge, skills, and competencies related to blockchain technology. Utilizing interviews, the study provides a comprehensive evaluation of how well CPAs are equipped to handle the complexities of blockchain. The findings highlight significant gaps in blockchain education and training within the accounting profession, indicating a need for targeted professional development initiatives. The study identifies critical areas where CPAs need support and offers actionable recommendations to enhance their readiness in an evolving technological landscape. Addressing these gaps will better position the accounting profession to meet the demands of a future where blockchain technology plays a central role in financial reporting, auditing, and compliance.

Keywords: Agency Theory, Blockchain, Crypto Assets, Cryptocurrencies, Small CPA Firms
