Abstract

This study examines the impact and underlying mechanisms of corporate Directors' and Officers' (D&O) liability insurance on tax compliance using data from Chinese A-share listed companies. The findings reveal that purchasing D&O insurance significantly increases corporate tax avoidance. Besides, D&O insurance provides senior executives with an effective risk-sharing mechanism, which enhances their risk appetite and reduces management intensity. Moreover, the effect of D&O insurance on tax avoidance is significant in state-owned enterprises and firms with stronger internal audits and external financial supervision, while it is insignificant in non-state-owned enterprises and firms with weaker internal and external oversight. T

Keywords: Directors' and Officers' liability insurance, Tax compliance, risk appetite, Inner management
