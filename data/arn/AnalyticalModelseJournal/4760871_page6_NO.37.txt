Abstract

Private equity (PE) funds are sophisticated asset managers that focus on generating returns for investors. Despite this fact, many studies conclude that PE funds often use a tax-inefficient organizational form for their portfolio companies (e.g., startups), incurring a tax cost of about 5% of funds’ invested capital. Using a model that more fully incorporates PE fund taxation, we find the opposite result: analyzing the same data as prior research, we find that PE funds save about 8% of invested capital by using the supposedly ‘tax-inefficient’ organizational form for their portfolio companies versus the alternative organizational form. However, this tax advantage is not borne equally by investors, including fund managers who face additional taxes of about 0.1% of invested capital under the ‘tax-inefficient’ organizational form. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 reduces the tax differences across portfolio companies’ alternative organizational form choices. Our model informs PE fund managers evaluating organizational form choice and policymakers considering potential outcomes of tax changes. More broadly, we are the first to incorporate heterogeneous investor-level taxes into an organizational form model. We demonstrate that this innovation in our model can generate vastly different organizational form preferences than suggested by existing models.
