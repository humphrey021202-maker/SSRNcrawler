Abstract

We explore financial market structures that incentivize firms to prioritize ESG. Borrowers may prefer reducing expected interest payments by pursuing ESG over financial prof- its, particularly at high borrowing rates. However, competition between ESG-friendly and non-ESG lenders lowers equilibrium borrowing rates, discouraging ESG prioritization. When firms privately know their true ESG preferences, early-moving ESG-friendly lenders can “cleanse” the ESG capital market. Specifically, non-ESG lenders perceive holdout borrowers as those with strong ESG preferences and thus charge high borrowing rates so that even non-ESG borrowers pursue ESG to reduce interest payments. Ultimately, promoting lender competition may deter rather than support ESG integration.

Keywords: Socially responsible investments, ESG, moral hazard, adverse selection, financial market structure, greenwashing
