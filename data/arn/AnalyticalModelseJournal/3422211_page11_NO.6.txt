Abstract

We study informational freeriding in a model where agents privately acquire information and then decide when to reveal it by taking an action. Examples of such freeriding are prevalent in financial markets, e.g., the timing of IPOs, analysts' forecasts, and mutual funds' investment decisions. The main results show that, in large populations, few agents provide significant information while the vast majority of agents freeride. We highlight the role of uncertainty and market size in shaping the dynamics of price discovery. Our predictions include, among others, that heightened uncertainty enhances information production, yet weakens the precision and speed of information aggregation in the market.

Keywords: Informational freeriding, information provision, endogenous timing, information acquisition, forecasts, delay, herding, clustering

JEL Classification: C73, D82, G14, H41
