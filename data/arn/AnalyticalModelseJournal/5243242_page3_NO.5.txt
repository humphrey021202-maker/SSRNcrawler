Abstract

This study explores how Chief Financial Officer (CFO) integrity influences earnings management in Chinese listed firms, advancing our understanding of ethical leadership in financial decision-making. We propose a novel proxy by leveraging the academic ethical standards of universities where CFOs graduated, to capture CFOs’ ethical foundations. Our results indicate that firms led by CFOs with higher integrity are less likely to engage in earnings management, as evidenced by significantly lower levels of discretionary accruals. This effect is more pronounced in private firms, those with fewer analyst coverages, and in regions with higher marketization standards. Our findings extend upper echelons theory by linking formative educational experiences to financial outcomes and refine ethical leadership theory by situating integrity within China’s institutional heterogeneity. We contribute to management scholarship by showing how personal traits interact with contextual factors to shape organizational behavior in an emerging economy. Practically, we suggest boards prioritize CFO integrity in selection processes and regulators target governance enhancements in less marketized regions, offering insights for fostering ethical cultures and improving financial reporting quality in transitional settings.

Keywords: CFOs Integrity, Earnings Management, Academic ethic, Corporate Governance
