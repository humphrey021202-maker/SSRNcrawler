Abstract

This study examines the relationship between Chief Executive Officer (CEO) narcissism and repetitive language in corporate disclosures, focusing on the repetition of content from financial statement notes in the Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) sections of US 10-K reports. Drawing on agency and impression management theories, we investigate whether narcissistic CEOs use repetition strategically to reinforce key corporate messages or to obscure less favorable information. Using a sample of 20,511 firm-year observations from 2002-2020, we quantify repetition in the MD&As through the four textual similarity metrics of Cosine Similarity, Jaccard Similarity, Minimum Edit Distance, and Simple Similarity. We measure CEO narcissism based on first-person singular pronoun usage in earnings call transcripts. Our findings reveal that narcissistic CEOs engage in more repetitive disclosures, but contrary to conventional views suggesting obfuscation, this repetition serves an informative purpose. The relationship between CEO narcissism and repetitive disclosure is particularly pronounced for insider CEOs, female executives, and firms with Big 4 auditors. The results are robust to endogeneity concerns. We contribute by offering new insights into how CEO personality traits shape corporate communication strategies.

Keywords: CEO narcissism, Corporate communication, MD&A repetition, textual analysis, corporate disclosure
