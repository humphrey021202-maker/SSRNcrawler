Abstract

This study examines whether financial analysts purposefully issue more pessimistic earnings forecasts during weekday non-trading hours. We show that downward forecast revisions released during weekday non-trading hours draw less market attention, resulting in weaker negative stock price reactions than those released on weekends or trading hours. Such differential market responses to bad news provide analysts with an opportunity to minimize the adverse market impacts of their negative forecasts. Consistent with this notion, we find that analysts are more likely to issue downward forecast revisions during weekday non-trading hours than during weekends or trading hours. We further suggest that the incentive for timing decisions is related to analysts’ rational considerations of forecast quality. Specifically, the documented timing phenomenon is more prominent for analysts who are less certain about negative earnings forecasts due to more opaque information environment of the forecasted firms and less forecasting experience and knowledge specific to these firms. Our findings offer new insights into analysts’ strategic forecasting behaviors.

Keywords: analyst forecasts, timing decision, investor attention, forecast quality
