Abstract

The increasing demand for corporate sustainability disclosure has raised concerns about its impact on firm performance, yet the role of institutional investors in this relationship remains underexplored. This study examines the mediating role of institutional investors in the nexus between sustainability disclosure and firm performance, addressing the gap in existing literature on how investor dynamics influence corporate sustainability strategies. The study employs a panel dataset of 152 publicly listed firms over ten years, applying the fixed effects model (FEM) and random effects model (REM) regression to assess the direct and indirect effects of sustainability disclosure on financial performance. The findings reveal that while sustainability disclosure positively impacts firm performance, institutional investor ownership significantly enhances this effect by fostering long-term value creation and risk mitigation. The study contributes to the corporate finance and sustainability literature by providing empirical evidence on the moderating role of institutional investors, offering practical insights for policymakers, investors, and corporate managers. Unlike prior studies, this research integrates investor behaviour into the sustainability-performance framework, advancing the discourse on responsible investment and corporate financial outcomes.
