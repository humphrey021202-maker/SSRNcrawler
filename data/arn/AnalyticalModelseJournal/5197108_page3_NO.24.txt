Abstract

This study investigates how firms strategically interact with their peers in determining financial reporting quality (FRQ), particularly in sensitive environments. Using an instrumental variable approach, we provide robust empirical evidence that a firm’s FRQ is significantly influenced by the financial reporting practices of its peers.  We identify a novel "industry spotlight effect," where firms not only improve their FRQ but also align more closely with their peers when their industry faces heightened scrutiny, such as during M&A deal withdrawals or financial distress. Our findings have important implications for regulators, investors, and corporate managers, offering new insights into the strategic dynamics of financial reporting in competitive and high-pressure settings.

Keywords: Strategic Interaction, Financial Reporting Quality, Peer Effect, Sensitive Environment
