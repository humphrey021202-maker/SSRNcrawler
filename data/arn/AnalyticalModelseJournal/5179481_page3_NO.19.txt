Abstract

This paper studies shareholder voting with third-party advice. Specifically, I investigate whether shareholders make more informed voting decisions after having received a proxy advisory firm's report. I find that the proxy advisor enters the market if its report can encourage supplemental research. This finding challenges the current orthodoxy, which is that shareholders use the proxy advisor's report as a substitute for independent research. Taking the proxy advisor's strategic entry decision leads to the opposite conclusion: the proxy advisor's report is complementary to independent research.

Keywords: Information Processing, Shareholders' interests, Voting, Proxy Advisor, Information Design, Bayesian Persuasion, Vote Recommendation
