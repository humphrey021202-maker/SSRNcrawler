Abstract

Using hand-collected audit data from Malaysian banks, we find that Islamic banks incur significantly lower audit fees than conventional banks. Marginal effects indicate that Islamic banks pay half the fees of conventional banks after controlling for the cross-sectional determinants of audit pricing. The fee discount decreases as auditor expertise in Islamic banking—proxied by specialization and diversification—rises. We find no significant differences in audit quality between Islamic and conventional banks, suggesting that lower audit fees do not compromise quality. Ultimately, our study provides compelling evidence that Islamic banks are, indeed, getting “more bang for their buck”.

Keywords: Islamic banking, audit fees, Audit quality, matching estimators, Lasso regression
