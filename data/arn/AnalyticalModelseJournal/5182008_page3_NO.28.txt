Abstract

Abstract：This study aims to explore the influence of short-term debt for long-term investment (SDFLI) on the quality of corporate information disclosure (IDQ) based on agency theory. Results indicate that SDFLI significantly reduce IDQ.According to the mechanism analysis, SDFLI exacerbates financial risk and agency costs, thereby suppressing IDQ. Additionally, the inhibitory effect of SDFLI on IDQ was more significant in non-state enterprises, enterprises with weak internal controls, and low external financial supervision.

Keywords: Short-term debt for long-term investment, financial risk, agency theory, information disclosure quality
