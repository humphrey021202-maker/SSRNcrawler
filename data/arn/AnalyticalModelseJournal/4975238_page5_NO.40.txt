Abstract

Research Question/Issue: Does the presence of academic directors on corporate boards reduce the likelihood of corporate violations, and under what conditions is their role most effective?

Research Findings/Insights: Using data on Chinese listed firms from 2008 to 2022, we find that both the presence and proportion of academic directors are associated with significantly fewer corporate violations and a lower probability of severe penalties. These effects are economically meaningful and remain robust across multiple specifications, including dynamic analysis, difference-in-differences estimation, and tests for endogeneity and self-selection. Consistent with their reputational concerns, we also show that academic directors are more likely to leave firms following misconduct. Their effectiveness is strongest when other internal and external monitoring mechanisms are weak, and in financially distressed and low visibility firms.

Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our study identifies the role of academic directors as a distinctive governance mechanism, extending board diversity and agency theory research. We demonstrate that reputational incentives and professional norms differentiate academics from other independent directors, providing new evidence on how board composition shapes firms’ ethical conduct.

Practitioner/Policy Implications: For firms, academic directors can strengthen board oversight and reduce exposure to regulatory sanctions. For policymakers, encouraging firms to include academics on boards may improve governance quality, particularly in emerging markets where external enforcement is limited.

Keywords: Academic directors, Corporate violations, Director functions, Corporate governance
