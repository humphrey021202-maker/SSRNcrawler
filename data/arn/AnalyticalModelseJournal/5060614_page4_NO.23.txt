Abstract

The paper explores the macroeconomic determinants influencing Nepal's economic growth from 1974 to 2021 using the ARDL model and ECM approach. Variables such as foreign direct investment (FDI), import, export, exchange rate, and inflation were tested for their long and short-term effects on economic growth. The study used various analytical techniques such as Unit Root Tests, ARDL Model to Cointegration Tests, ECM Model, Bound Tests, and related stability tests. The result of the bound test shows that there is a long-run relationship between GDP and its macroeconomic determinants. The findings indicate imports' positive and significant impact on GDP, while the other variables showed statistically insignificant effects. The results have implications for policymakers promoting sustainable economic growth through strategic imports.

Keywords: GDP growth, ARDL model, Nepal, macroeconomic determinants, imports, inflation
