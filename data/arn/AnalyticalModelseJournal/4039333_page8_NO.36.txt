Abstract

This study adopts behavioral contract theory through a mathematical model and clarifies the situation in which a fixed–salary contract is preferable to incentives–based one for the principal. Theoretically, the expected utility for the principal is higher under an incentives–based contract but, in reality, there are companies that employ people via fixed–salary contracts. This study found that, in the multitasking case, a case exists in which the principal should offer a fixed–salary contract, and due to behavioral elements, compensation contracts will become inefficient; however, inefficiency may be reduced by using appropriate performance measures.


Keywords: Compensation contract, Behavioural contract theory, Fixed salary contract, Performance evaluation
