Abstract

We examine how enforcement institutions' inspection focus disclosure influences financial reporting quality through managers' misreporting and auditors' effort choices. We find that disclosure can either enhance or deteriorate financial reporting quality and highlight the influential factors. We explore how enforcement institutions can influence these conditions by increasing the detection probability or the imposed penalties. Thus, we propose that enforcement institutions should carefully assess whether to disclose or conceal their inspection focus. Our model makes the empirical prediction that disclosing enforcement inspection focus is associated with higher misreporting and lower audit effort if the auditor's reaction to the disclosure is related to high costs.

Keywords: Financial Enforcement, Enforcement Design, Inspection Focus Disclosure, Audit Quality, Misreporting, Financial Reporting Quality
