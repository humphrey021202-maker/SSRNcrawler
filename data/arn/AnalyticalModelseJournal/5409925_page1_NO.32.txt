Abstract

This paper studies how shareholder voting shapes competition for capital in equity markets where investors share homogeneous preferences over financial returns but differ in their preferences for social impact. In our model, two firms strategically choose their initial social positions and set share prices to attract investors. Investors self-select into firms based on anticipated financial returns and alignment between their social preferences and expected firm behavior, which is determined by shareholder voting. We find shareholder voting results in less extreme firm positions, thereby intensifying price competition and reducing equilibrium differentiation. Paradoxically, shareholder voting on social impact leads to improved social welfare, although it may result in a lower average social impact and a smaller investor base for the more pro-social firm. We also highlight that a broader concern for externalities-where investors care about the social behavior of both firms rather than only their own holdings-further amplifies strategic interactions. Our findings provide new insights into how shareholder voting and endogenous shareholder composition jointly shape firm strategy in competitive capital markets.

Keywords: Shareholder Democracy, Shareholder Engagement, Shareholder Voting, Investor Activism, Social Preference, Social Impact, Impact Investing
