Abstract

Analyzing a sample of U.S. firms, we observe that, following the pandemic, auditors (1) increase audit fees, (2) experience longer audit reporting delays, and (3) tend to lower audit quality, as evidenced by higher discretionary accruals and minor earnings increases. However, we find no effect on auditors’ decisions regarding the issuance of going-concern opinions or opinions on internal control material weaknesses. Our findings partially confirm that with COVID-19 auditors are more cautious in reporting delays, probably because of the pandemic’s adverse psychological impact, challenges in gathering audit evidence, and/or limitations on audit fieldwork.

Keywords: COVID-19 pandemic, Psychology, Audit Fees, Audit Reporting Lags, Earnings Quality.
