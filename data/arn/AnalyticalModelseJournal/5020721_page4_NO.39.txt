Abstract

We observe the influence of foreign and institutional ownership on the quality of financial reports for 10 years (2013-2022) among the 151 publicly listed companies on the Nigerian Exchange (NGX). We employ quantitative analysis in our observations and use panel data of 1,510 observations. The results reveal that both foreign and institutional ownership positively affect the quality of financial reports. However, only firm size and profitability show positive significant effects among the control variables. We therefore conclude that foreign, institutional ownership, firm size, and profitability are drivers of quality financial reports in Nigeria. We recommend that firms include foreign and institutional owners in their equity capital. Nonetheless, this study is limited to Nigeria, and may not apply to non-emerging economies. Also, our R 2 is 22.95 percent, which suggests that more observations should be included; this is doable by either increasing the period covered or adding another economy with similar financial reporting frameworks. The work is novel because it is the first to use aggregate country-level panel data to estimate the influence of foreign and institutional owners on Nigeria's financial reports' quality.

Keywords: firm leverage, firm profitability, firm size, foreign ownership, institutional ownership, quality of financial reports. JEL Classifications: C23, C58, C87, M21, M24, M48
