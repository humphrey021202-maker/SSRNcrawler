Abstract

This study creates and analyzes a model in which the income from intellectual property (IP) owned by a domestic parent and foreign subsidiary must be shared between the domestic and foreign countries for tax purposes. The model focuses on the effects of the commensurate with income standard, under which the future realized values of the IP are used to evaluate the sharing arrangement, even though these values were unknown to the taxpayer when the sharing arrangement was established. Greater weight on the realized value induces more aggressive auditing by the tax authority but could induce the taxpayer to be either more or less aggressive. Putting all the weight on the realized values generates higher domestic tax revenue compared to a hypothetical full-information benchmark case when audit costs are low, but lower domestic tax revenue relative to that benchmark when audit costs are high.

Keywords: transfer pricing, intangible assets, multinational taxation

JEL Classification: H25, H3, M41, M48
