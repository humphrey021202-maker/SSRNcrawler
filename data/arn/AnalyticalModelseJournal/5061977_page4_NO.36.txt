Abstract

Regulators and practitioners have expressed concerns that risk factor disclosures (RFDs) are dispersed across an excessively large number of topics, which may hinder investors’ ability to process the risk information therein. We develop a novel measure of RFD topical dispersion using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm and provide evidence that the excess component of  RFD topical dispersion is positively associated with stock price crash risk. Further analyses suggest that excess RFD topical dispersion partly reflects distorted disclosure incentives arising from litigation risk and managers' earnings management strategies. We also find the effects of excess RFD topical dispersion are concentrated when short selling constraints are higher, suggesting that information processing difficulties are indeed responsible for the increased crash risk. Our findings demonstrate that firms’ disclosures can expose investors to elevated crash risk while providing \textit{more} negative information.

Keywords: Risk factor disclosure, Crash risk, Information processing
