Abstract

We study the canonical signaling game, endowing the sender with commitment power: before learning the state, the sender designs a strategy that maps states into probability distributions over actions. We show that commitment power can overturn familiar results in signaling models. We provide a geometric characterization of attainable payoffs, given by the topological join of the interim payoff graphs associated with sender actions. Extending the model to include payoff-irrelevant messages, we characterize payoffs when the sender commits to both messages and actions or to messages alone, and apply the framework to adjudication procedures and rating systems.

Keywords: Signaling, Information Design, Legal Procedure, Financial Advice

JEL Classification: C72, D82, D83, G24, K4
