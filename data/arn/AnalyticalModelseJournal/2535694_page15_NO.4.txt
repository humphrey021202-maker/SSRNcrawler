Abstract

This paper treats risky investment projects under adverse selection and considers optimal penalties for erroneous auditing reports that maximize social welfare. These penalties give firms an incentive to choose accounting policies that maximize social welfare. We characterize the optimal penalties so that efficient firms choose aggressive accounting policies and inefficient firms choose conservative accounting policies.

Keywords: Accounting policy, Audit, Investment Efficiency, Optimal Penalty

JEL Classification: D8, M4
