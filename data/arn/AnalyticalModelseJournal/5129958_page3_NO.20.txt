Abstract

Amid escalating global environmental challenges, understanding how technological advancements drive sustainable innovation has become a critical topic. This study empirically examines the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) adoption on corporate green technological innovation using a sample of Chinese-listed companies from 2010 to 2023. The findings indicate that AI adoption significantly enhances green innovation performance. Additionally, the CEO green experience positively moderates the relationship between AI and green innovation, amplifying AI's positive impact. Furthermore, internal control quality and R&D investment are identified as mediating mechanisms through which AI influences green innovation, unveiling the internal pathways through which AI fosters sustainable innovation. By revealing these mechanisms, this study deepens the understanding of how AI drives sustainability within corporate structures. It not only provides empirical evidence on AI's role in promoting green innovation at the firm level but also highlights the importance of executives' environmental awareness and the roles of internal control and R&D investment. These findings carry significant practical implications for companies aiming to achieve sustainability through AI and for policymakers seeking to promote green innovation through technological advancements.

Keywords: Artificial Intelligence, Green Technological Innovation, CEO Green Experience, Sustainable innovation, Corporate Social Responsibility
