Abstract

More than half of S&P 500 CEOs receive options annually, however extant valuation models have not accounted for portfolio considerations. We show the inability of executives to diversify means portfolio effects matter: exercise thresholds and shareholder costs are lower than for stand-alone options and vary with portfolio size and composition. The model explains which options to exercise first and how exercise can be induced by new grants, matching empirical findings. Ignoring portfolio composition may invalidate estimates of exercise thresholds, bias inferences about executive characteristics (e.g. optimism) drawn from them and overstate costs, particularly for executives with larger portfolios.

Keywords: executive stock options, employee stock options,executive compensation, option portfolios, risk aversion, exercise thresholds

JEL Classification: G11, G13, G30, J33
