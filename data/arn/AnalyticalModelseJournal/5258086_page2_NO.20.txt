Abstract

Islamic fintech startups are emerging as pivotal players in the digital financial landscape, offering innovative solutions that align with Sharīʿah principles. However, these ventures encounter distinct governance challenges that can impede their growth and credibility. One primary issue is the lack of standardized Sharīʿah compliance frameworks. Islamic jurisprudence varies across regions, leading to differing interpretations of what constitutes Sharīʿah compliance. This inconsistency poses challenges for fintech companies aiming to scale globally. (Tech Bullion) Another significant concern is the shortage of qualified professionals who possess both a deep understanding of Sharīʿah principles and the technical skills required for modern financial practices. This talent gap hampers the ability of startups to develop and manage Sharīʿah-compliant fintech solutions effectively. (RSIS International Musaffa Academy) Furthermore, the governance structures of these startups often lack transparency and accountability. Sharīʿah Supervisory Boards (SSBs), which are essential for ensuring compliance, sometimes face challenges related to their independence and effectiveness. The employment and compensation of SSB members by the same institutions they oversee can compromise their objectivity. (Faster Capital).(Wikipedia) Regulatory frameworks also pose challenges. The absence of clear and harmonized regulations for Islamic fintech can lead to legal uncertainties, deterring investment and innovation. In regions like Pakistan, the lack of coordination among federal and provincial agencies further complicates the establishment of a robust digital Islamic banking ecosystem. (Dawn) Addressing these governance issues is crucial for the sustainable development of Islamic fintech startups. Implementing standardized Sharīʿah compliance frameworks, investing in talent development, ensuring the independence of Sharīʿah boards, and establishing clear regulatory guidelines are essential steps toward fostering a trustworthy and effective Islamic fintech ecosystems.
