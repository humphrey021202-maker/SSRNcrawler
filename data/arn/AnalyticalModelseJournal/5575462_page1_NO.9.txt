Abstract

We develop a model in which firms face cognitive costs when making precise decisions. The model predicts that stricter tax enforcement incentivizes firms to pay greater attention in production and commit fewer optimization errors. Leveraging China’s 2002 corporate income tax reform as a natural experiment, and using a regression discontinuity design (RDD), we find that stricter tax enforcement reduces firm misoptimization, leading to more efficient resource allocation. Despite the increased tax burden, profitability growth—measured by per worker operating profit growth—improves post-reform, suggesting that efficiency gains offset the financial costs. Robustness checks confirm the validity of these findings, highlighting the broader economic implications of tax enforcement on firm performance.

Keywords: attention allocation, misoptimization, tax enforcement, Chinese economy
