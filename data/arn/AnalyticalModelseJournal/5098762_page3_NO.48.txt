Abstract

This study investigates the relationship between audit committee characteristics and tax aggressiveness in publicly traded companies from 2014 to 2023. The purpose is to explore whether key attributes of audit committees, such as independence, size, meeting frequency, and gender diversity, influence the extent of tax planning activities that deviate from statutory compliance. Using a panel dataset of 153 firms across eleven (11) industries, a pooled (ordinary least squares) regression model was employed to analyze the impact of audit committee attributes on effective tax rates (ETR) as proxy for tax aggressiveness. The findings reveal that audit committee gender diversity and independence are negatively associated with tax aggressiveness, suggesting that robust governance reduces aggressive tax practices. Conversely, size and frequent meetings are positively associated with levels of tax planning, reflecting a balanced approach to tax strategies. The study’s originality lies in its decade-long analysis, capturing shifts in corporate governance practices and tax policies over a critical period marked by evolving regulatory environments and global financial challenges. These insights provide practical implications for regulators, policymakers, and corporate boards aiming to optimize governance structures and mitigate tax-related risks.
