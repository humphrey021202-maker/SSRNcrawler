Abstract

We investigate the role of global factors in driving cross-border capital flows. We formulate a model of gross capital flows through the banking sector and derive a closed form solution that highlights the leverage cycle of global banks and its interaction with recipient country characteristics. We test the predictions of our model in a panel study of 46 developed and emerging economies and find empirical support for the key predictions of our model.

Keywords: Gross capital flows, leverage, credit booms and busts

JEL Classification: F32, F33, F34
