Abstract

This study examined the impact of effective book keeping practice and accounting system in the operation of small and medium scale enterprises in Nigeria. Research hypotheses were formulated according to the objective of this study. 286 Small and medium business owners and 214 staff from five recognized local government areas in Zamfara state, North Western Nigeria were selected as our respondents via a stratified random sampling technique. Data were collected via a well structured questionnaire. Best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) was used to analyze the data, hypotheses were tested using t-test and all the hypotheses were retained. The findings of this study revealed that book keeping and accounting plays a significant role in the success of small and medium scale enterprises. The study also affirms that standard accounting practices contribute immensely to the success of small and medium scale enterprises. The study recommends among others that Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN) should provide an atmosphere that will facilitate good adoption of effective bookkeeping and accounting practice in small and medium scale enterprises (SMEs) in Nigeria.
