Abstract

Reducing information processing costs is widely seen as a means to improve price informativeness and overall welfare. In this paper, we develop a model to examine the real effects of such cost reductions on corporate investment levels and their welfare implications for capital market participants. We show that corporate investment follows an inverted U-shaped pattern with respect to processing costs. This non-monotonic relation follows from two opposing forces. On one hand, lower processing costs improve price informativeness, which reduces agency frictions and increases entrepreneurs' financing capacity. On the other hand, they increase speculators' trading profits in the secondary market at the expense of initial investors, forcing entrepreneurs to compensate initial investors for future losses and reducing their financing capacity. Moreover, since trading profits are merely transfers among market participants rather than net gains, lowering processing costs does not necessarily benefit entrepreneurs or investors, nor does it always enhance overall welfare.

Keywords: Information processing costs, corporate investment, real effects

JEL Classification: G14, G31, M41
