Abstract

We show that a manager can manipulate shareholder voting purely through the choice of disclosure volume, without needing any informational advantage or ability to design or bias her disclosures. If shareholders costlessly process signals, the manager's task becomes a straightforward sample-theoretic problem. With costly information processing, the manager takes advantage of the fact that shareholders cannot pool their information in equilibrium. Instead, shareholders condition their beliefs on their votes being pivotal. This conditioning requires each shareholder to make assumptions about the other shareholders' signals, which in turn depends on the amount of publicly available information that the manager provides.

Keywords: Disclosure, Disclosure Volume, Information Design, Voting, Bayesian Persuasion
