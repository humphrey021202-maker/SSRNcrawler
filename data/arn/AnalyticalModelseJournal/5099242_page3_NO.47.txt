Abstract

This study investigates the relationship between board independence and earnings management, focusing on its implications for corporate governance and financial reporting quality. The research evaluates whether a higher proportion of independent directors on corporate boards mitigates earnings management practices, thereby enhancing transparency and accountability. The study covers ten years from 2014 to 2023, utilizing data from 153 publicly traded companies across various sectors. A panel data methodology was employed, combining financial statements and corporate governance reports. The analysis applied an Ordinary Least Squares regression analysis to examine the impact of board independence on accrual-based earnings management, measured using the Modified Jones Model. Robustness checks were conducted to ensure the validity of findings, including alternative specifications and additional control variables such as audit quality, profitability, liquidity, institutional ownership, firm size, and leverage effects. The results reveal that board independence is negatively and significantly associated with earnings management, indicating that independent directors play a crucial role in curbing opportunistic financial reporting. Specifically, firms with a higher percentage of independent board members exhibited lower discretionary accruals, suggesting enhanced oversight and governance. These findings remained consistent across various robustness tests. This study makes an original contribution by providing empirical evidence from an emerging market context, where governance practices often differ from developed economies. It highlights the importance of regulatory frameworks promoting board independence to improve financial reporting quality. The findings have implications for policymakers, regulators, and corporate stakeholders in designing effective governance mechanisms to safeguard shareholder interests and enhance market confidence.
