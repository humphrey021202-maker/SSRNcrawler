Abstract

The model formalizes the idea that active monitoring by shareholders generates positive externalities for peer firms. Shareholders gather information to disentangle different performance factors and subsequently intervene with firm management. A cross-firm information externality arises because intervention transmits private information about common industry conditions to peer firms. The externality has various implications: shareholders may benefit from closer monitoring at peer firms and mimic peer interventions. Monitoring choices are strategic substitutes. Externalities can provide a rationale for common ownership of informationally related firms.

Keywords: Corporate Governance, Active Monitoring, Information Externality

JEL Classification: G30, G34
