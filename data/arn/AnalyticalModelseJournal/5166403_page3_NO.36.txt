Abstract

This study examines how IFRS adoption in developed countries affects information asymmetry, considering national characteristics. Using market liquidity and bid-ask spread as proxies, it analyzes short- and long-term economic impacts from 2001 to 2022. While IFRS adoption aims to reduce information asymmetry, its effectiveness varies due to cultural and institutional factors, including religious values, legal norms, and political motivations, as well as the time since adoption. By integrating these temporal and cultural dimensions, the study provides new insights into global financial reporting and offers implications for policymakers, standard setters, and investors. The findings highlight the need to consider national contexts when evaluating IFRS's impact across jurisdictions.

Keywords: bid-ask spread, comparative study, market liquidity, national character.
