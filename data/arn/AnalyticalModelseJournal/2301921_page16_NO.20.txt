How 'Skepticism Wins' in Regulation

Abstract

For many regulatory decisions, agencies deal with conflicting considerations, such as drug innovation and drug safety, or investment opportunities and economic stability. Regulated firms tend to place more weight on one side because of their financial interest. Given this bias, an agent can increase a political principal's payoff by being not just "skeptical"---having the opposite bias---but more skeptical than she. Through a formal model, extra skepticism is shown to benefit a principal by inducing firms to expend more effort to generate higher quality information, which may persuade the agent to do what they prefer, and which leads to more accurate decision-making. This logic contrasts with other studies' findings that benefits come from an agent with moderate preferences that lie in between the principal's and firms'. Drug regulation by the Food and Drug Administration and policymaking by the Securities and Exchange Commission are offered as concrete examples.

Keywords: effort, information, agency, drug regulation, financial regulation
