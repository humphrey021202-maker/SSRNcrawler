Abstract

The role of law in economic development has been a subject of extensive scholarly debate. This paper examines how legal institutions (such as property rights, contract enforcement, and governance frameworks) affect economic growth. The major problem addressed is whether a strong legal framework is a prerequisite for economic development or merely a facilitating factor. The primary objective of the study is to assess the significance of legal structures in fostering economic stability, investment, and overall economic progress. Using a qualitative research methodology, the paper reviews existing literature and empirical studies on legal and economic interactions. Findings indicate that well-structured legal institutions enhance investment security, reduce corruption, and improve market efficiency. Conversely, weak legal frameworks hinder economic growth by creating uncertainty, fostering corruption, and discouraging investments. The paper also points to the ongoing tax reforms in Nigeria, emphasizing the transition from the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) to the Nigerian Revenue Service (NRS) and its potential impact on revenue generation, economic diversification, and governance. The study concludes that law plays a fundamental role in economic development by ensuring stability, regulating markets, and providing mechanisms for dispute resolution. Effective legal institutions contribute to sustained economic growth, while weak enforcement undermines progress. Strengthening legal frameworks, particularly in tax administration and governance, is essential for achieving long-term economic transformation.
