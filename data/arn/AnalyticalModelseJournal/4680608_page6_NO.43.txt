Abstract

This paper examines how costly verification and liquidity constraints affect contracting features in private firm acquisitions. We theoretically compare two forms of target performance-sensitive consideration: seller debt, which is enforced by asset foreclosure, and earnouts, which are enforced by costly verification of performance and cash flows. Our empirical results from a broad sample of private deals support the models' empirical predictions that acquisition capital structure favors seller debt as liquidity constraints and verification costs rise, while earnouts become more common when verification costs fall. These results suggest that market uncertainty and contingency verification through accounting systems are important determinants of post-acquisition capital structure.
