Abstract

This paper analyses the role of leading indicators that provide a firm manager with learning incentives of firm-specific skills. The effectiveness of leading indicators varies with contract scheme hired between the firm owner and the firm manager. I show that the leading indicator complements the outcome’s role of incentive provision at the sacrifice of information rent caused by the information asymmetry regarding manager’s learning capacity.

Keywords: Informativeness; Leading Indicators; Learning effort; Moral hazard; Short-term contracts

JEL Classification: D82, J41, M40
