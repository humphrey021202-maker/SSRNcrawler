Abstract

Extant analytical work studying investments in the presence of earnings manipulation typically considers either one-period models or models where manipulation has only short-term effects. However, beyond transitory misreporting of private information, manipulation can also occur through deviations from optimal operations to enhance short-term pay at the expense of long-term value a la "real earnings management". In this paper, we incorporate the long-term adverse consequences of such manipulation on firm value in a dynamic contracting model with capital investments. We find that designing an incentive-compatible contract that prevents manipulation with persistent effects comes at the cost of inefficient investments in working capital. Overinvestment is more likely in firms with high cash flow but low Tobin’s q. Our findings provide a theoretical explanation for the strong investment-to-cash-flow sensitivity and weak investment-to-q sensitivity observed in empirical studies.

Keywords: dynamic agency, manipulation, real earnings management, persistence, overinvestment
