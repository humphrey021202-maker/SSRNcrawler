Abstract

Relative performance evaluation (RPE) is often used to filter out common shocks, but is prone to collusion. We study how RPE is affected by the playing field in terms of performance measurement or the production technology. While a tilted playing field is always costly in a static setting, it can be useful in a repeated setting, because it makes it harder for agents to collude. We identify conditions under which the principal prefers independent or joint performance evaluation if the playing field is level, but prefers RPE if is sufficiently tilted. In industries characterized by relatively low productivity, even with a level playing field, the principal may offer the agents asymmetric contracts as the cheapest way to combat collusion.

Keywords: Relative performance evaluation (RPE), collusion, mutual monitoring, level playing field, diversity

JEL Classification: M41, D82, G30
