Abstract

Nigeria's heavy reliance on crude oil exports exposes its economy to significant risks stemming from oil price volatility. This study empirically investigates the relationship between oil price volatility and economic growth in Nigeria, addressing the persistent macroeconomic instability associated with fluctuating global oil markets. The study employs annual time-series data spanning 1981-2023 and utilizes a Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) to examine both short-run and long-run dynamics. Findings reveal a negative and statistically significant impact of oil price volatility on economic growth in the long run, while trade openness, government spending, population growth rate, and technological progress exert varying degrees of influence. Institutional factors moderate the volatility-growth nexus, underscoring the role of governance quality. Limitations include data constraints and model specification sensitivity. The study provides practical insights for policymakers to enhance economic resilience through diversification and institutional reform. It contributes original empirical evidence from a major oil-dependent economy.

Keywords: economic growth, government spending, institutional factors, oil price volatility, population growth rate, technological progress
