Abstract

The fundamental finding of all standard agency models such as Holmström (1979) and Holmström and Tirole (1993) is that the agent’s pay-for-performance sensitivity rises with improvements in the stock-based signal-to-noise ratio. I show that this finding is never true. The greater the predictive ability of an informed speculator viewing the actions of the agent and hence the better the signal-to-noise ratio, the  lower pay-for-performance sensitivity, and more beneficial the contract. Resolving the current conflict between theory and evidence and consistent with all available empirical evidence, a better signal must necessarily generate a lower stock-based incentive weight.

Keywords: Liquidity, Agency, Incentives, Franchise, Signal-to-Noise

JEL Classification: G34, J41, J44, L25
