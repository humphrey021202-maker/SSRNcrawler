Abstract

We characterize ﬁrms’ aggregate reporting quality in an economy where a rational capital market as well as a regulator discipline ﬁrms’ reporting choices. When the regulator is resource constrained, multiple aggregate reporting choices are possible in equilibrium. This multiplicity is driven not just by the regulatory constraint, but also by how this constraint interacts with managerial incentives and the level of reporting discretion available to ﬁrms. We discuss the empirical implications of these findings.

Keywords: compensation, regulation, crises

JEL Classification: G18
