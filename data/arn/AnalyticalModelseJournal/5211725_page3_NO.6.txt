Abstract

This paper develops a dynamic model of sequential voluntary disclosure in which two firms make disclosure decisions under either exogenous or endogenous timing. The model isolates the correlation in firms' information endowments as the primary economic force, while allowing for variation in managerial myopia. In the exogenous-timing setting, the presence of a peer firm increases the ex-ante likelihood of disclosure, irrespective of the disclosure sequence, even though mutual withholding could yield higher prices for both firms. This effect intensifies as the correlation of information endowments increases. In the strategic-timing setting, the firm discloses high realizations promptly, delays the disclosure of intermediate realizations, and withholds low realizations. Signaling effects and real option value of delaying disclosure arise endogenously from this equilibrium structure. Furthermore, managerial myopia has opposing effects on disclosure across the two regimes: under exogenous timing, myopia raises disclosure thresholds and reduces disclosure, whereas under strategic timing, it lowers disclosure thresholds and induces earlier disclosure.

Keywords: Strategic Timing, Peer Effects, Voluntary Disclosure, Managerial Myopia
