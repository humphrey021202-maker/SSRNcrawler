Abstract

Motivated by the present-value framework, this article proposes a novel and flexible semiparametric long-horizon time-varying model to investigate the so-called `pockets of predictability', which refer to local periods in which stock returns or cash flows are significantly predictable. A semiparametric profile method is used to estimate both time-varying and constant parameters. In the empirical studies, the predictive ability of the dividend-price ratio for dividend growth is significant in up to 67% of the sample period 1926-2022, which is considerably weaker than its ability to predict stock returns at both short and long horizons. Dividend smoothing only matters for dividend growth predictability at a low frequency. In addition, localized variance decomposition analysis suggests that the present-value relation is valid locally for most sample periods and that the main driver of the variation in the dividend-price ratio stems from the predictability of stock returns. Lastly, the empirical results using the earnings-price ratio are similar.

Keywords: Present-value model, time-varying coefficient, semiparametric estimation, dividend smoothing, variance decomposition
