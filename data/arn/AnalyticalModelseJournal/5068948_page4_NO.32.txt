Abstract

This study examines the behavior of self-employed taxpayers in Ecuador who "bunch" just below an income threshold that transitions them from a simple to a complex tax regime. Under the simple regime, individuals file taxes independently, while the complex regime requires a public accountant. Using tax authority data from 2011–2014, we document this bunching behavior and assess its impact on taxes paid. Employing "donut" estimators to address endogeneity, we find taxpayers bunch below the threshold to avoid the complex regime. Surprisingly, total tax liability, including filing costs, is lower just above the threshold, contrary to standard labor supply model predictions under downward tax notches. Our findings highlight accountants as key drivers of this effect, helping taxpayers maximize deductions and often resulting in zero taxes paid.

Keywords: Tax Regimes, Progressive Taxes, Personal Income Tax, Bunching.
