Abstract

In this dissertation, I address two central research questions. First, I open the black box of manager-auditor negotiations to examine how financial statements are endogenously shaped through strategic interaction under information asymmetry. Second, I investigate how this negotiation process affects financial reporting quality. I develop a two-round negotiation game in which the manager, possessing private information about earnings, makes an initial offer and a potential counteroffer. The auditor, facing potential overstatement penalties, responds strategically while retaining the option to extend the audit-a costly activity for both parties. This framework allows auditor conservatism and managerial conservatism to emerge endogenously. I show that the manager-auditor negotiation leads to conditional overstatement or understatement and produces a non-monotonic, asymmetric pattern in financial reporting quality. Additionally, the model predicts a discontinuity in the distribution of reported earnings. These results offer new theoretical insights into the micro-foundations of auditing and yield testable implications for empirical research on financial reporting quality and earnings distribution.

Keywords: negotiations, auditor conservatism, managerial conservatism, financial reporting quality, discontinuity
