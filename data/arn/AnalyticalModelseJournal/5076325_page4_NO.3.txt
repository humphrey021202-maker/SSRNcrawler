Abstract

To increase firms' capacity-utilization rate, their idle capacity must be effectively used by acquiring additional orders. Traditionally, management accounting has employed the contribution margin approach to effectively use idle capacity-e.g., by accepting special orders. Thus, achieving full capacity utilization is recommended from the perspective of economies of scale. Recent research has focused on understanding cost behavior vis-à-vis capacity utilization. However, the effective use of idle capacity to bring the utilization rate close to 100 percent may result in congestion costs. In this study, congestion costs were modeled based on queuing theory and then incorporated into cost behavior. The optimalutilization rate-i.e., the target-was modeled through simulations. This optimal utilization method can be applied to foster appropriate utilization management, field operation improvement activities, standard capacity setting in standard costing, and revenue management, as seen in dynamic pricing.

Keywords: queuing theory, cost of congestion, cost function, profit function, CVP analysis
