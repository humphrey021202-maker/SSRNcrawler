Abstract

A foundational approach is developed for a mathematical theory of managerial disclosure in relation to asset pricing; this involves both the earnings guidance disclosed by firm management and market trackers pricing the firms exposure to quotable risks.

Keywords: risk-neutral valuation, asset-price dynamics, earnings guidance, optimal censoring, materiality, state observer system
