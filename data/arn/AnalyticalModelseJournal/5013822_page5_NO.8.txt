Abstract

Purpose This study explores the impact of strategic management accounting, tax knowledge, and competitive advantage on tax compliance, with a focus on organizational performance as a mediating variable.Design/methodology/approachPrimary data were gathered through a structured questionnaire distributed to manufacturing companies in Banten, Jakarta, and West Java. Respondents included staff, general managers, CEOs, and business owners. Inferential statistical analysis was conducted using partial least squares (PLS) to assess the relationships among the variables.Findings - The findings indicate that strategic management accounting, tax knowledge, and organizational performance each have a direct, significant impact on tax compliance. While competitive advantage does not directly affect tax compliance, it exerts an indirect positive influence through organizational performance. Notably, strategic management accounting does not have a direct effect on organizational performance. Additionally, organizational performance does not mediate the relationship between either strategic management accounting or tax knowledge and tax compliance.Originality / ValueThis study offers new insights by examining the role of increased tax payments in enhancing tax compliance behavior, particularly in the context of rising contributions to the national treasury relative to income. A unique survey instrument was developed to assess the connection between tax payments and compliance, providing fresh perspectives on compliance behavior within the corporate sector.

Keywords: Tax Compliance, Strategic Management Accounting, Tax Knowledge, Competitive Advantage, Organizational Performance
