Abstract

This research explores the impact of private capital flows on political accountability in recipient nations, focusing on how investments such as foreign direct investment (FDI), portfolio investments, and remittances shape governance dynamics. The study aims to determine whether increased private capital inflows enhance governmental transparency and responsiveness or contribute to political opacity and elite capture. Employing a mixed-methods approach, it combines quantitative analysis of panel data from 60 developing countries over three decades with qualitative case studies from diverse regions. Key findings indicate that while private capital flows can improve political accountability by increasing economic engagement and stakeholder pressure, their effects depend heavily on institutional frameworks and regulatory quality. Specifically, countries with stronger institutions leverage private capital to foster greater political responsiveness, whereas weaker institutional environments risk increased corruption and reduced accountability.

Keywords: political accountability, foreign direct investment, portfolio investments
