Abstract

This paper examines how Generation Z's financial maturation will affect the future of luxury branding. It synthesizes industry analyses and scholarly studies on Gen Z's values and spending habits to assess whether luxury consumption will increase or decrease as this cohort gains income. Key factors include Gen Z's large market influence and willingness to spend on high-end goods, contrasted with their ethical priorities, caution during economic uncertainty, and interest in experiences or secondhand alternatives. The analysis finds that Gen Z is poised to represent a substantial share of luxury purchases (projected 25-30% by 2030voguebusiness.com), suggesting potential growth if brands adapt. However, evidence of "underconsumption" trends, social-media-driven austerity (e.g. "No Buy 2025"), and a preference for sustainability indicate challenges for traditional luxury brandingfirstinsight.combain.com. In conclusion, luxury branding will likely transform rather than uniformly rise or fall: growth in some segments (e.g. personalized, ethical luxury) may be offset by declines in others (e.g. conspicuous consumption), depending on how well brands align with Gen Z's values and shopping behaviors.

Keywords: Generation Z, Luxury Branding, Consumer Behavior, Sustainability, Experiential Marketing, Second-Hand Market
