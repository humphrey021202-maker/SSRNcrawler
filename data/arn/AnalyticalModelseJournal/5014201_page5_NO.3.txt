Abstract

Acknowledging the increasing weight of public regulation and social pressure to deal with climate change, several corporations are setting home-made prices on carbon, which they apply internally to make decisions on operations and investments. Known as internal carbon pricing (ICP), this practice has triggered a fast-growing, largely empirical, research literature – in management, accounting, and economics, notably – which investigates its rationale, its execution, and its impact on firms and the environment. This paper reconsiders internal carbon pricing from an environmental economics perspective. We thereby submit a unifying conceptual framework that would support upcoming research and further advise the dissemination and adoption of ICP.

Keywords: business sustainability, firm internal markets, corporate climate policy, Carbon pricing, Global value chains

JEL Classification: D21, M21, M41, Q53
