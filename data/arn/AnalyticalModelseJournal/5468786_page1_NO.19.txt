Abstract

Auditing services are provided by a team of professionals with similar or different attributes. This study analyzes how audit team composition (homogeneous vs. diverse) affects audit quality and investment efficiency. We develop a dynamic audit team production model in a repeated game of audit engagements. We explore how partner conservatism and staff myopia shape team cultures in both types of audit team composition. Our analysis suggests that a homogeneous team may provide higher audit quality due to productive synergy, whereas a diverse team can be better because members from diverse backgrounds do not collude. We find that diverse teams are desirable when partner conservatism is high and staff myopia is low or when partner conservatism is low and staff myopia is relatively moderate. Overall, our results highlight subtle yet important forces that determine the optimal audit team composition, offering various policy and empirical implications.
