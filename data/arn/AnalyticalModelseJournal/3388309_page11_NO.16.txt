Abstract

This paper examines how public disclosure about a firm's fundamental value affects the firm's stock price efficiency when investors interpret such disclosure heterogeneously. In a noisy rational expectations equilibrium, learning from prices and higher-order beliefs result in a market-clearing price that relies excessively on investors' collective knowledge about the fundamental. As a result, in both long-horizon and short-horizon economies, while improving disclosure clarity generally increases price efficiency, improving disclosure transparency can decrease it. In the latter case, the interior level of transparency that maximizes price efficiency monotonically increases in clarity. In other words, the best attainable level of price efficiency hinges on the level of clarity.

Keywords: heterogeneous interpretations, transparency, clarity, price efficiency, Keynesian beauty contest

JEL Classification: D82, G12, G14, M41
