Abstract

Convertible debt is an important financing tool for companies, offering lower capital costs than traditional debt. Its growing use highlights its increasing role in corporate finance. Early research suggests that convertible debt can help reduce agency costs between shareholders and debtholders, which originate from shareholders’ underinvestment issues. When ownership and control are separated, managers often have more decision-making power than shareholders and may prioritize personal gain over shareholder interests. This underscores the need for compensation mechanisms that encourage managers to work for the company’s overall benefit. This paper builds on that by exploring the agency problems between managers and shareholders, as well as between managers and debtholders. By incorporating convertible debt into capital structure models, the study examines how it influences the interactions among managers, shareholders, and both types of debtholders. Our analysis shows that higher expected income, salary, and ownership stakes can lead to overinvestment. However, with convertible debt, managers may underinvest to avoid sharing profits with debtholders. If a project’s EBIT reaches the conversion threshold, debtholders may convert their debt into equity, shifting returns to shareholders and managers. Including convertible debt in the capital structure increases the likelihood of conversion, enhancing the value of the investment option but also leading to more underinvestment and higher agency costs.

Keywords: convertible debt, managerial discretion, underinvestment, agency costs
