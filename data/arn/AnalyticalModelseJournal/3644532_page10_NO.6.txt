Abstract

We develop a model of information acquisition in capital markets and empirically test its predictions. In the model, investors are uncertain about the returns to acquiring private information before they acquire it. This results in a novel reason for why past price movements impact future capital market outcomes: investors use public information, including prior prices, as a screen to estimate the value of private information acquisition and efficiently allocate their limited information-processing capacity across firms. The model predicts that larger unexplained price movements lead to more private information acquisition, higher future price volatility, and higher future trading volume. Using fine-grained data measuring information acquisition on Edgar and Bloomberg, we provide empirical evidence in support of the model's predictions.

Keywords: Information Acquisition, Market for Information, Higher-Moment Uncertainty, Investor Attention, Edgar Downloads, Bloomberg, Earnings Announcements, Big Data
