Abstract

We consider a two-period learning model featuring a sequentially-rational regulator, which tries to build a reputation for strict enforcement, and self-interested firms, which test the regulator's enforcement propensity through their misconduct. We find that peer learning between the firms yields more misconduct than when misconduct and enforcement are not observable between the firms, because the regulator's reputation concern creates enforcement externalities between them. When the regulator's reputation concerns are sufficiently strong, these enforcement externalities dominate the information externalities and heighten misconduct. Although seeking to develop a strong reputation for enforcement always benefits the regulator in the opaque setting, it often backfires in the presence of peer learning in a transparent setting.

Keywords: Experimentation, Peer Learning, Reputation, Enforcement Externalities, Transparency

JEL Classification: D82, D83, G18, M41, M48
