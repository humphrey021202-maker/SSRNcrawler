Abstract

We consider outcomes of profit decisions from an analysis of economic data and an analogy with natural science principles.  First, we assess what constitutes a healthy economy and articulate our view that profits are necessary for that health. Next, we utilize an analogy of economic cash flow with physical heat energy flow that leads to an indicator of economic health.  Next, we examine options for managing corporate profits and use available data and cash-flow relations to show the economic consequences of profit decisions.  We conclude that direct investment of profits, rather than delaying reinvestment or sequestering them in accounts or luxury purchases unavailable to generate new value, is best for economic health.  Finally, we suggest a policy that would encourage healthy profit decisions.

Keywords: Profit Distribution, Reinvestment, Consumer and Producer Confidence Indexes, Temperature Gradient Causes Cash Flow, Non-Value-Added Tax
