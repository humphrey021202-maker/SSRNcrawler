Abstract

A market-leveraged stock unit (MSU) is a form of employee compensation in which the number of shares received on the vesting date depends on the stock price at that time. MSUs have been proposed as a way of overcoming some of the drawbacks of stock options and restricted stock units. In this paper, we show how MSUs can be valued and discuss their properties.

Keywords: employee compensation, MSU, RSU, option, valuation

JEL Classification: M52
