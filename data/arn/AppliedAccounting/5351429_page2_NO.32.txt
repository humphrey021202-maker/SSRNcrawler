Cross-Border Tax Issues for Artists

6 Pages Posted: 1 Aug 2025

Dick Molenaar

Erasmus School of Law - Section Tax Law

Date Written: July 12, 2025

Abstract

Over the first 25 years of this century, the income for artists has shifted from royalties to touring income. This has consequences for cross-border taxation, because royalties from foreign sources are taxed differently than income from foreign performances. The article discusses article 12 OECD Model and the deviation from the UN Model, besides Article 17 OECD Model, together with the UN and US Model. Performance income has more risk of double or excessive taxation than royalty income and that should change.
