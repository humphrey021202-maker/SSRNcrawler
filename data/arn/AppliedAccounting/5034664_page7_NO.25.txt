Abstract

Purpose

The purpose of this paper is to enhance conceptual understanding and practical operationalisation of boundaries (i.e., what is included and not included in annual report sections) and connectivity (i.e., the attribute enabling a holistic and coherent set of information within and across different annual report sections) of climate-related disclosures in annual reports.

Design/methodology/approach

We analyse operationalisation of boundaries and connectivity in climate-related disclosures in the annual reports of 80 large listed companies, across five climate-sensitive industries and four IFRS jurisdictions (Australia, Canada, the EU and the UK) in 2022 and 2017. We compare boundary and connectivity guidance by contemporary sustainability and financial accounting standard setters. Further, we provide multidisciplinary stakeholder perspectives on boundary and connectivity concepts through 20 semi-structured interviews in Australia and the EU. 

Findings

While all sampled companies refer to climate-related matters in the ‘front end’ (i.e., outside of the financial statements) of annual reports in 2022 (94% in 2017), only 71% disclose within their financial statements (25% in 2017). We identified connectivity mechanisms to enhance connectivity between the financial statements and sustainability statements for climate-related disclosures, relating to the reporting process (6 mechanisms), reports (21 mechanisms) and standard setting (4 mechanisms). Interviewees indicated an increase in reporting process connectivity mechanisms over the last five years, but most reports sampled reflected an early level of connectivity in disclosures. Standard setters are providing increased guidance on connectivity mechanisms.   

Originality

A conceptual framework of connectivity mechanisms for climate-related disclosures in annual reports is proposed, based on interpretation of prior literature, comparative analysis of contemporary standards, observed disclosures, and multi-disciplinary stakeholder interviews. Further, we provide a comparative analysis of boundary dimensions of contemporary accounting and sustainability standards relating to climate. This contributes to prior literature on climate-related reporting, and scarce literature on reporting boundaries and connectivity within corporate reporting, especially in the new era of mandatory climate reporting.

Practical implications

The detailed empirical analysis on reporting boundaries and connectivity mechanisms provides useful insights for sustainability and financial accounting standard setters, auditors, preparers and users of annual reports.
