Abstract

Comprehensive, credible, and comparable accounting standards are essential to creating an enabling regulatory environment for scaling-up investment in developing countries to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. Enhanced disclosure and transparency through quality accounting raises investor confidence and helps deepen capital markets, which makes the implementation of developmental policies more effective. In this context, accountants play a unique and strategic role in creating economic incentives for sustainable finance by encouraging a greater focus on long-term fundamentals.

Keywords: sustainability, transparency, non-financial reporting, integrated reporting, financial accounting, IFRS, GAAP

JEL Classification: M41, Q56
