Abstract

OVER the past few weeks, there has been much interest in the issue of tax avoidance and whether high-earning professionals such as doctors and dentists have been engaging in tax avoidance schemes.

Tax avoidance is a technical legal term which has a precise meaning in law. This can be compared to the more general term of "tax dodging", which has no such technical legal meaning. In light of this, we think it might be useful to explain the concept of tax avoidance.

Keywords: Tax Law
