Abstract

Strategic ignorance rarely has been an official U.S. administrative policy. Rather, sunshine and transparency have been the rally cry for those seeking to combat discrimination, bias, and corruption. Strategic ignorance, however, may have greater utility for government administration than may initially appear. This chapter examines the use of strategic ignorance of informational source to facilitate tax enforcement. Specifically, this chapter contemplates applying the lessons of scientific trial literature to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax whistleblower program to eliminate bias against the use of whistleblowers at certain decision points in tax enforcement.

Keywords: tax, Internal Revenue Service, whistleblower, bias, cognitive bias, blinding, allocation concealment

JEL Classification: k23, k34
