Abstract

Like a modern major general who divides all matters into animal, vegetable, or mineral, the Internal Revenue Code essentially divides all noncorporate interest expenses into business, investment, passive, or personal. This rigid classification could cause some profit-seeking real estate activities to give rise to nondeductible personal interest expense.

Specifically, an analysis of land held for investment leads to a circular reference in the Internal Revenue Code and its regulations. Without clarification to the contrary, a taxpayer could be at risk of having nondeductible personal interest expense. Missing and circular references may become more frequent as the tax law grows more intricate and arcane, especially in other complex areas such as the international tax regime (with equations both simple and quadratical) and the centralized partnership audit rules as enacted by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015.


Keywords: interest, passive activity loss, rental real estate, investment activity
