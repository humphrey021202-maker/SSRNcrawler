Abstract

Financial modeling and forecasting is important for current and future sales for firms and the financial actors within the firm. It doesn’t only tell you where you need to go but also reminds you of where you have been. It tells you the past, current, and future numbers. With these numbers a firm is able to compare what they have been doing wrong or right and change what they need to fix. There are many ways to forecast your finances like using conditionalism as a methodology for decision making, or different forecasting models like Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIPA), the Weighted Average Least Squares (WALS), and Simple Average Forecast Combination Model.

Keywords: Finance, Managerial Accounting, Forecasting, Stock Markets, Models

JEL Classification: M41
