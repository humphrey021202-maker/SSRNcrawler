Abstract

Under the current U.S. tax system, corporations have an incentive to defer the repatriation of their foreign earnings. This incentive is commonly referred to as the lock-out effect. The lock-out effect is significant, as estimates indicate that U.S. corporations hold nearly $2 trillion of earnings in foreign jurisdictions. While the U.S. tax system creates an incentive to retain these earnings abroad, research suggests that a non-tax factor, financial reporting incentives, exacerbates this lock-out effect. This study informs the debate regarding the lock-out effect by discussing evidence that financial reporting incentives significantly affect U.S. corporations’ tax policy responses.

Keywords: financial reporting incentives, corporate tax reform, lock-out effect, repatriation
