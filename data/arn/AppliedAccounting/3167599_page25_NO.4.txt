Choice of Entity by Reason of Tax Rates

Tax Notes, Vol. 158, No. 12, 2018

U of Texas Law, Public Law Research Paper

7 Pages Posted: 7 May 2018

Date Written: March 2018

Abstract

Johnson argues that looking at rates alone, owners subject to the new 29.6 percent rates for qualified business income should organize as passthroughs unless they will accumulate business earnings for at least 23 years, and that the C corporation form should be chosen for post-death sales and entities subject to 37 percent tax rates. He warns that the recent instability of entity choice will likely continue.
