Abstract

A careful analysis of the jurisprudence discloses no principled common law foundation for characterizing the joint venture as a distinct legal form. Might it nevertheless be desirable to legislate the joint venture into legal existence? The Alberta Law Reform Institute has made that recommendation. The objectives and deficiencies of the proposal are breathtaking.

Keywords: joint venture, partnership, business organization, tax, fiduciary duty, joint and several liability, law reform
