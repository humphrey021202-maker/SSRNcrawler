Abstract

The primary purpose of this systematic review is to identify and synthesize the personal, academic, institutional, and systemic factors that influence the performance of Filipino BS Accountancy graduates in the Certified Public Accountant Licensure Examination (CPALE), with the goal of addressing persistently low pass rates and offering evidence-based guidance for improving licensure outcomes and accounting education in the Philippines. Using a systematic review approach, the study analyzed empirical literature from 2010 to 2025, including quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods studies conducted within the Philippine context, and applied structured inclusion criteria to ensure the credibility and relevance of peer-reviewed research. The results reveal that academic performance—particularly cumulative GPA and disciplined study habits such as time management, group study, and practice testing are strong predictors of CPALE success. Institutional interventions like peer tutoring, mock exams, and consistent progress monitoring were found to significantly improve examinee preparedness, though disparities in institutional resources and teaching quality lead to unequal outcomes across higher education institutions. A notable finding is the apparent misalignment between academic curricula and licensure requirements, which hampers student readiness for the exam. Systemic challenges, including stagnant national passing rates and insufficient structural reforms, remain unresolved. Additionally, qualitative insights from student testimonials highlight overlooked yet critical barriers, including curriculum overload, weak foundational knowledge, mental burnout, and a lack of institutional support. These findings imply the need for a comprehensive, multi-level response, involving curriculum alignment with CPALE content, enhanced faculty development, stronger institutional support systems, and broader policy-level reforms. Future research should further explore less-studied areas such as mental health, socioeconomic background, and the impact of academic competitions on licensure success. Overall, this review offers a strategic, evidence-based framework for educators, institutions, and policymakers seeking to improve CPALE performance and strengthen the accounting education system in the Philippines.
