Abstract

University tuition costs continue to increase, while education continues to be important. Efforts to alleviate this problem must be undertaken carefully as to not simply aggravate the problem. To this end, this Article proposes that parental contribution towards university tuition be treated more favorably by the tax code, and in particular, be treated as tax deductible. Universities already expect parental contributions as part of a child’s financial aid package, and this proposed tax deduction may help fulfill that expectation. Furthermore, this proposed deduction would spare students some reliance on the loan system, including the risk of default. This proposed deduction, finally, may be structured in a cost-neutral way. Specifically, the funds used for this deduction would be the taxpayer funds saved from the decrease in loan defaults and loan interest subsidies, which currently cost tens of billions of tax dollars.

Keywords: tax, tax law, tax policy, deduction, family law, domestic relations, student loans, student federal loans, tuition, college, university, postmajority support, child support, postsecondary educational expenses
