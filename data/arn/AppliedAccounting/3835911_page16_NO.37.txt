Abstract

This article examines the “tax-follows-book” principle through the lens of partnership distributions of property with reverse section 704(c) items and details ways the law could ensure that post-distribution allocations of tax items follow pre-distribution allocations of book items.

Keywords: partnership distribution, section 704(c), section 751
