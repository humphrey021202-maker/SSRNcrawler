Abstract

This National Report was prepared for a conference titled Tax Secrecy and Tax Transparency – The Relevance of Confidentiality in Tax Law, which took place in July 2012 in Rust, Austria and was co-hosted by the Institute for Austrian and International Tax Law at the Vienna University of Economics and Business and by Örebro University, Sweden. The Report describes the current tax privacy protections that apply to taxpayers in the United States and provides an overview of the policy considerations that have contributed to their enactment. Portions of this Report were originally published, in part, in Joshua D. Blank, In Defense of Individual Tax Privacy, 61 Emory L.J. 61 265 (2011). This National Report was published in Tax Secrecy and Tax Transparency – The Relevance of Confidentiality in Tax Law (Peter Lang GmbH – Internationaler Verlag der Wissenschaften, Frankfurt, Germany) (2013).
