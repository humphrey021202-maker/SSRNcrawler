Julian Reif

University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign

Date Written: June 23, 2014

Abstract

In this report, I estimate the revenue that could be generated by increasing Illinois sin taxes on cigarettes, alcohol, and gambling. I discuss the efficiency and distributional effects of those taxes, as well as potential savings from a reduction in cigarette and alcohol consumption.

Keywords: Illinois, sin taxes, cigarettes, alcohol, gambling

JEL Classification: H71, H21, H23
