Abstract

Multinational Banks operate on a wider economic and geographical spectrum and are faced with vast challenges in each economic territory. There is however general observation that multinational banks do not make proper disclosures on portfolios operating in hyperinflationary economies as outlined in International Accounting Standard (IAS) 29. Consequently assets of multinational banks are overvalued due to lack of monitoring mechanisms in compliance with IAS 29. Bank regulators in various jurisdictions have daunted task to develop mechanisms of improving the financial sector through compliance with IAS 29.

Keywords: Multinational, Hyperinflationary, Banks, IAS29, Accounting
