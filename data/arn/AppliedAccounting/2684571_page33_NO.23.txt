Abstract

The proliferation of inexpensive yet complex business programs has allowed many small businesses to start operations and even setup online stores. These small businesses are able to generate and manage thousands of transactions. Most of these systems do not have an accounting module and the businesses have to later find an accounting systems and knowledge to generate the necessary accounting reports and ledgers. While many accounting packages also abound, the connection between the business module and the accounting packages are lacking and have become the bottleneck. This paper presents an intermediate application (called Viable Accounting Server) that can easily import data from most business applications and export it to an accounting application.

Keywords: Accounting, Accounting Information Systems, Data conversion
