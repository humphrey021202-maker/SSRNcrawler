Abstract

The growing presence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Human Resource Management (HRM) is not only transforming operational processes but also raising fundamental questions about fairness, transparency, and ethical accountability. Despite widespread enthusiasm, the conditions under which AI can meaningfully support HR decision-making remain unclear particularly in emerging economies where digital infrastructures evolve faster than institutional ethics. This study investigates how ethical perception, intelligibility, accountability, social acceptance, and strategic AI utilization collectively influence the effectiveness of AI-based HRM decision making. Drawing on socio technical theory and normative ethical climate theory, the research examines whether organizational ethical climate acts as a contextual amplifier or constraint in these relationships. Instead of treating ethics and technology as separate domains, this work frames them as interdependent forces within HR systems. The study contributes to ongoing discussions about algorithmic trust, perceived legitimacy, and the strategic embedding of AI in people management practices. It raises a critical question: can organizations truly benefit from intelligent systems without ethical alignment, or will such systems undermine long-term legitimacy? Findings offer a conceptual basis for rethinking ethical governance in AI adoption, particularly for leaders navigating transformation in volatile, culturally diverse contexts.

Keywords: AI in HRM, Ethical Perception, AI Accountability, Strategic Utilization, Organizational Ethical Climate
