Abstract

We calculate the tax lives that would correspond to measures of economic depreciation under a recent study by Geltner and Bokhari that measures economic depreciation incorporating data on capital improvement expenditures. Using those new measures, we find that tax depreciation for nonresidential and residential buildings under current tax law is slower than economic depreciation, assuming moderate levels of inflation.

Keywords: depreciation, cost recovery, tax lives

JEL Classification: H25
