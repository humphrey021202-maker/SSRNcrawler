Abstract

In short sales, capital gains are realized upon the replacement of the borrowed stock, and not upon its disposition by the short seller. Therefore, a taxpayer can simultaneously own a share of stock and short sell an identical stock to effectually dispose a share of stock without triggering a taxable realization event and avoid capital gains tax. This creates a tax deferral opportunity unregulated by current laws. Short sales can also lead to a complete tax avoidance scheme if the stockholder dies after the short sale but before the replacement of the borrowed stock. The law should be amended to recognize the delivery by the short seller of the borrowed property to a third party buyer as a realization event and the delivery of the owned property to replace the borrowed property as another realization event. This amendment addresses the tax deferral loophole that allows avoidance of capital gains tax.

Keywords: capital gains, income tax, short sales, stock-borrowing transaction
