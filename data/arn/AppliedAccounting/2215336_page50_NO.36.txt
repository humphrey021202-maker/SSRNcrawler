Abstract

This study examines goodwill reporting disclosures in Australia under AASB 136 – Impairment of Assets from the period 2005 to 2010. It explores the extent to which the disclosures complied with the mandatory requirements for impairment testing for goodwill after the implementation of the ‘impairment regime’ in AASB 136. Using a sample of 287 Australian-listed firms, we found improved compliance with almost all disclosure items explored, while non-disclosure was found to be higher for more complicated disclosures. Several firms persistently provided no required disclosures. These findings suggest that some auditors and preparers are failing to comply with mandatory requirements, a potential concern for regulators.

Keywords: goodwill, AASB 136, impairment, Australia

JEL Classification: M40, M41
