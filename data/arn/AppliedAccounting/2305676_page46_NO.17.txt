Abstract

This paper considers components of the Liquidity Coverage Ratio – as well as certain prevailing gaps which may necessitate the introduction of a complementary liquidity ratio. The definitions and objectives accorded to the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) highlight the focus which is accorded to time horizons for funding bank operations. A ratio which would focus on the rate of liquidity transformations and which could also serve as a complementary metric given certain gaps which currently prevail with the Liquidity Coverage Ratio, as well as existing gaps with other complementary liquidity monitoring tools, is proposed.

Keywords: Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA), liquidity monitoring tools, objectivity, comparability, transparency, disclosure
