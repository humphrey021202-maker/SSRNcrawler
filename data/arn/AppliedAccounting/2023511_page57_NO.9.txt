Date Written: March 2012

Abstract

Citizens are departing high tax US states for low tax rates. These effects are particularly strong among bordering states. Each positive 1 percentage point tax burden differential between states decreases the ratio of income migration into the high tax state by 6.78 percent in a given year. This paper highlights the states which are regionally competitive (Texas and Tennessee), regionally non-competitive (California, Florida, and New Jersey), and those states on the edge of being non-competitive on all borders (Illinois and New York).

Keywords: Taxes, Income, Migration, Burden, New Jersey

JEL Classification: H20, H71, J6
