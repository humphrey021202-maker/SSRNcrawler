Abstract

In common law jurisdictions, auditors’ civil liabilities toward individual shareholders, the true payer of their income, is limited. Similarly, auditors do not take equivalent personal liability as their client in recent financial regulation reforms, even though they play a critical role in the scandals. A legislation proposal in Hong Kong may provide the first step towards the right direction.

(Section numbers of the Companies Ordinance is changed after it became into force in 2014. The main section of criminal liabilities of auditors in s.399 of legislation status discussed in this article was re-numbered as s.408.)

Keywords: Professional Liabilities, Duty of Care, Negligence, Auditors, Caparo v Dickman

JEL Classification: K13
