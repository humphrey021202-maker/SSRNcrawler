Abstract

In this article, the author examines, through numerical examples, the effects would EU Member States subject taxpayers – both residents and non-residents – deriving income from domestic sources, to unlimited income taxation whilst granting double tax relief for foreign income under a Netherlands-style tax exemption. This paper, the third in a series of three, scrutinizes the effects from the perspective of how such an approach would affect the taxation of cross-border intra-firm transactions.

The results show that the approach taken reveals the building blocks for an income tax system devoid of primary EU law discriminations and restrictions. It is fully consistent with the fundamental freedoms. The author presented these findings at the 2nd Annual Doctoral Meeting held by the Oxford University Centre for Business Taxation in September 2012.
