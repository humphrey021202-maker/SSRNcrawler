Partners as Employees? Properly Reporting Partner Compensation

Abstract

As partnerships increasingly offer equity interests to retain valued employees, these employees may be unaware of the employment tax consequences of receiving a partnership interest. Many partnerships continue to treat those former employees who hold partnership interests as employees for employment tax purposes, even though the IRS clearly believes these employee/ partners cannot be employees. If the IRS discovers this treatment, the possible consequences go far beyond employment tax liability. For example, it might cause a grant of an unvested partnership interest to fail to qualify for the safe harbor in Rev. Proc. 2001-43. One solution to the tax filing complexity that employees face when they become partners would be for Congress to enact legislation allowing partnerships to file composite partnership U.S. federal income tax returns.

Keywords: partnership tax, Rev. Proc. 2001-43, profits interest, partnership compensation, partnership employee
