Abstract

As part of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Congress enacted Section 1400Z-2, which allows property owners to reinvest gain from the disposition of property in qualified opportunity funds (QOFs) tax free. This article illustrates how this new provision is different from the most popular commercial real estate disposition nonrecognition provision—Section 1031. Section 1400Z-2 is attractive because it not only defers gain recognition, it allows property owners to exclude any post-acquisition gain that accrues by holding the property for at least 10 years. Section 1031 now only applies to real property, so property owners have greater re-investment alternatives in QOFs. The article also recognizes that Section 1400Z-2 does not appear to have been fully vetted, so it comes with some mistakes and many open issues. Looking past those shortcomings, the article presents a numerical example comparing a hypothetical Section 1031 exchange into real property to a reinvestment of gain into a QOF. That comparison shows that 10 years following the reinvestment, the property owner would be better off under the Section 1400Z-2 regime than under Section 1031.

Keywords: qualified opportunity fund, QOF, section 1031, nonrecognition, gain deferral, gain exclusion.

A does not recognize gain on the receipt of that $160,000. A retains $40,000 in cash ($1 million selling price minus $160,000 savings account to pay 2026 taxes, minus $800,000 permitted to be deferred under §1400Z-2(a)(1)), and immediately invests in early 2019 the remaining $800,000 for slightly less than a 100% partnership interest in a QOF. Because of the §1400Z-2(a) exclusion, A avoids the 2019 $200,000 capital gains tax (25% × $800,000) on the gain rolled over into the QOF partnership interest in 2019. The QOF buys land for $800,000 in an opportunity zone and using a balloon non-recourse construction and permanent loan, makes depreciable additions to basis on such land of $3.9 million, which improvements are classified as non-residential real property, depreciable at a rate of $100,000 per year over 39 years. Even though A would otherwise have a zero basis in her QOF partnership interest and not be able to deduct allocated partnership deductions, her share of the QOF partnership's liabilities should give her basis in her QOF interest and allow her to deduct cumulative loss allocations. Notice that A would not be allowed to deduct cumulative losses currently if the QOF were an S corporation because the S corporation rules do not allocate S corporate liabilities to S corporation stockholders
Suppose Individual A, 45-years old in early 2019, early 2019, A sells the land for $1 million, realizing an $800,000 000 2026 tax projected in 2019). Because the $160,000 reflects the return of $160,000 of A's $200,000 basis (i.e., is not part of the gain realized)
000 proceeds not reinvested ($1 million proceeds from the sale of the land minus $800,000 paid for the opportunity zone land), but would retain the remaining $150,000, with no need to worry about financing any §1400Z-2(a) 2026 deemed gain tax under the QOF rules. (It is assumed that A does not choose to defer the $50,000 tax on the $200,000 by undertaking another $200,000 2019 like-kind exchange, although A could avoid that tax by reinvesting the full amount of the exchange proceeds)
A would be in the following position: In 2019, A would owe $50,000 2019 tax at a 25% capital gains tax rate on the $200
