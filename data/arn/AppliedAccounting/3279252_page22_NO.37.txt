Abstract

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 created substantial new tax benefits for taxpayers with capital gain, if they make certain investments in so-called "qualified opportunity zones" (QO Zones). The QO Zone tax benefits generally include permanent tax exemption of up to 15% of the recognized gain and tax deferral of the remaining gain until 2026. In addition, the taxpayer's gain from selling its QO Zone investments after 10 years is entirely exempt from tax. On October 19, 2018, the Treasury released an initial set of proposed regulations that address many QO Zone issues. However, old and new uncertainties continue to exist, particularly in the partnership area.

Keywords: qualified opportunity zones, partnerships
