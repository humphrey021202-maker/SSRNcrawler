Abstract

The emergence of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) represents a transformative force within the financial services sector, encompassing banking, investments, insurance, real estate, capital markets, consulting, and accounting. This paper examines the trajectory of AI advancements toward AGI and their anticipated effects on financial institutions, labor markets, and regulatory frameworks. While AGI offers unparalleled efficiency gains, it also introduces risks related to job displacement, market volatility, and ethical concerns. Current employment projections by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics may underestimate AGI's disruptive potential, necessitating a reassessment of workforce strategies and policy interventions. Furthermore, AGI-driven automation may shift global financial power dynamics, challenging the dominance of established financial hubs. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of these implications, offering insights into how financial professionals, policymakers, and institutions can prepare for the AGI-driven future.

Keywords: Artificial General Intelligence, financial services, automation, consulting, labor markets, AI ethics, regulatory policy
