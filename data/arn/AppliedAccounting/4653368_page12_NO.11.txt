Abstract

This outline covers significant developments in federal income taxation arising during the past year. It offers a selective treatment focusing on items likely to interest practitioners and advisors within a broad range of professional practices. Tax Court decisions (regular and memorandum) and appellate cases receive greater attention on account of their legal significance; Tax Court summary opinions and unreported appellate cases are generally omitted. Other trial decisions in the district court and claims court receive only limited attention due to their comparatively limited impact on tax law development. A few noteworthy administrative developments are also included, but their discussion is not comprehensive. Some employment tax cases are covered in part IX. Part X concludes with brief commentary on legislation. This outline reflects developments reported through November 17, 2023.
