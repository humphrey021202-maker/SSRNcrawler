Abstract

The paper discusses the development of competitive advantages for green technology-based innovative business models in the Georgian economic context, using a business case approach through the creation of situational and role-playing board games. The research aims to investigate how integrating sustainable technologies can enhance the competitiveness of small and mediumsized enterprises (SMEs) and promote the growth of the green business sector in Georgia. The study utilizes a mixed-method approach, combining in-depth interviews with experts and quantitative analysis of market trends. The findings indicate that companies implementing green technologies reduce their environmental impact and achieve significant competitive advantages, such as increased customer loyalty and access to new markets. Moreover, incorporating green elements into educational tools, such as situational and role-playing board games, facilitates young people's knowledge transfer and skill development, shaping a sustainable business mindset. The research highlights that green business models are essential for creating sustainable, developing, and globally competitive enterprises. This study thus underscores the role of innovative educational instruments in fostering green business practices and establishing long-term competitiveness in the Georgian business landscape.

Keywords: Green Technologies, Innovative Business Models, competitive advantage, Sustainable Development, Role-playing simulation board games
