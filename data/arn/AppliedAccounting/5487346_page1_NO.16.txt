Abstract

Purpose of review: This systematic review aims to map the current landscape of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) applications within economics and finance in sub-Saharan Africa. It seeks to identify dominant research trends, key application domains, model performance, emerging opportunities, and the significant socioeconomic implications of these technologies for the region. Recent findings: Current research demonstrates a significant surge in AI and ML adoption in African economics and finance, particularly since 2017. Key applications include: (1) poverty and economic wellbeing prediction using satellite imagery and alternative data sources, with models explaining over 70% of the variation in village-level wealth; (2) real-time economic nowcasting to track the impacts of major events like the COVID-19 pandemic; and (3) enhancing financial inclusion and risk management through AI-driven credit scoring and fraud detection, where models achieve F1-scores exceeding 0.80. Deep learning (DL) models, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for geospatial data and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for time-series forecasting, are pivotal. Summary: AI and ML are transforming economics and finance in sub-Saharan Africa by providing scalable, high-frequency, and granular data that bypasses traditional data gaps. These technologies offer transformative potential for evidence-based policymaking, financial stability, and inclusive growth. However, significant challenges persist, including data sparsity, infrastructural limitations, and the risk of algorithmic bias. Future advancements depend on developing localized, context-aware models, investing in data infrastructure, and establishing robust ethical governance frameworks to ensure equitable outcomes.
