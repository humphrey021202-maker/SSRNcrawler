Abstract

The Paper presents a model for analyzing financial and budgetary effects associated with the performance of regional airlines from their launch to maturity. It is an integrated (3statement) nominal financial model developed at a monthly frequency, with a number of innovative features that relate to internalizing the timing of repair and overhaul flags for the fleet. It provides and reconciles the derivation of FCFF and FCFE cashflows under both the direct and indirect method. The model also incorporates some advanced features, such as accounting for aviation subsidies, provisioning for the overhauls of Airframes and Engines, compliant with the Tax code and Aviation Guidelines, as well as the treatment of initial Tax Loss Carryforwards. The practical advantages of the model for regional airlines with the fleet of a few aircraft is that, only with minor modifications of its flexible hierarchical structure, the model allows them to support their business planning processes while seeking licenses, flight and subsidy approvals from Aviation Authorities, as well as actually optimize their long-term route maps and schedules with the eye to key financial parameters (e.g. ROE or NPV) on the basis of a few alternative and competing flight options proposed and researched by their marketing teams. Such a dual-objective financial model is handy for small regional airlines which can ill-afford to spend on sophisticated route-optimization software, such as SABRE of AIMS.
