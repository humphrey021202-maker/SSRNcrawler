Abstract

A compilation of the assets for a marital estate can provide an essential mechanism to identify marital property vs. separate property. This type of balance sheet is prepared using similar methodology as a balance sheet prepared in a financial statement for an operating business. The similarities lie in the use of analogous categories including assets, liabilities, and equity (net worth). However, a marital balance sheet is assembled using current market value as opposed to historical cost.

Keywords: marital assets, marital property, valuation, forensic accounting
