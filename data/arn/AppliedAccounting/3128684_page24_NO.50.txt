Abstract

Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606 (ASC 606), Revenue from Contracts with Customers, (FASB 2017c) is presented as standardizing revenue recognition principles to eliminate variation across industries and geographies. While it may be argued that standardization simplifies the revenue recognition process and will provide clarity for investors, ASC 606 adds significant complexity to the revenue recognition process for a producer or natural gas processor (processor). This paper addresses several areas that a producer or processor should consider in their application of the ASC 606.

Keywords: ASC, Natural Gas, Revenue Recognition

JEL Classification: M41
