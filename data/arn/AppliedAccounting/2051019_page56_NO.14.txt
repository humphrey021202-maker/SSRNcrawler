Abstract

The Supreme Court’s decision in Home Concrete raises new questions about the deference to be given to administrative pronouncements that conflict with prior judicial decisions. Unfortunately, the opinions of a divided Court leave practitioners to puzzle over the boundaries of its decision.

Keywords: Taxation, administrative law, administrative rules and regulations, Administrative Procedure Act, Treasury Regulation, judicial deference to IRS rulemaking, Chevron doctrine, Home Concrete, APA, Mayo Foundation

JEL Classification: K23, K34
