Abstract

As part of energy transition strategies, major oil companies have become key investors and developers of offshore windparks. Investor confidence in these investments have been negatively affected by a series of impairments, seen as a negative signal on future profitability, and oil company renewable investment strategies have been revised. The paper is to analyses oil company investment strategy, comparing petroleum and renewable projects, in terms of accounting and valuation. We pedagogically present offshore wind accounting and valuation methods, seen from the perspective of an oil company. Petroleum and offshore wind accounting differ in essential ingredients. Two UK cases are analysed, one initial profitable case and one later unprofitable case. We address high off-balance debt, negative book equity, and potential impairment. We address investment policy and strategy implications for oil companies of negative stock market response to offshore wind impairment and renewable investment generally.

Keywords: oil companies, investment strategy, offshore wind, accounting, impairment, valuation
