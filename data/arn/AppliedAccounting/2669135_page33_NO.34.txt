Abstract

Paredes (2003) uses the metaphor “blinded by the light” to illustrate the issue of “information overload”, as consumers of corporate reporting are exposed to too much information, and therefore reach information overload and become increasingly con-fused. This issue has been reflected in organizational development, accounting and information science according to (Eppler and Mengis, 2004) and the debate over a sub-stantial disclosure reform with the aim to solve the issue of information overload is ongoing and is discussed by several Accounting Standard Boards with different jurisdictions, including the IASB (Heffes, 2014 ) and the SEC (Lynch, 2013), and in several academic articles and books (Casey Jr, 1980, Stocks and Harrell, 1995, Speier et al., 1999, Möllers and Kernchen, 2011).

Since 2010, several organizations including the Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) and the International Accounting Standard Board (IASB) have kicked-off projects on the development of a disclosure frameworks, as the majority of preparers of financial statements as well as investors have together complaint about the disclosure overload (IASB, 2013). Just recently the chairman of the IASB Hans Hoogervorst has prioritised on communication effectiveness. He said: “Valuable information gets drowned out by ‘tick the box’ disclosures and voluminous, but poorly organised and presented, financial statements. For the investor, it is often difficult to see the woods through the multitude of information trees. We will take a fresh look at how financial information is presented, how it is grouped together, and in what form it is made available” (IASB, 2016).

This paper intends to provide a systematic literature review about the phenomenon disclosure overload in the accounting and disclosure-related literature.
