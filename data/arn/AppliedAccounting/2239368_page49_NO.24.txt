Abstract

Sticky costs occur when costs increase more when activity rises than they decrease when activity falls by an equivalent amount. In sticky costs literature cost behavior is evaluated by correlating the current growth in Selling General and Administrative costs with current revenue growth. Recently researchers spotted more attributes affecting the stickiness of cost. Managerial oversight, external economic conditions and firm characteristics are an example of such attributes hypothesized to influence a manager’s decisions in a demand’s fluctuation. Cost stickiness differs depending on corporate governance systems and managerial oversight, for different geographic regions. This paper presents the most important factors affecting sticky cost and the various implementations of this theory in real managerial decisions.

Keywords: Stickiness, Sticky Costs, SG&A costs, Resource Adjustment
