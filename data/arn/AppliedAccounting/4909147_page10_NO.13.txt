Abstract

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) agents in financial auditing has the potential to transform auditing practices. Leveraging large language models (LLMs), these autonomous systems can enhance auditing by managing complex and interdependent tasks. This study explores the progression from co-piloted LLM-enabled auditing to auto-piloted agent-enabled auditing. We introduce a framework for implementing AI agentic workflows in financial auditing. Through a detailed case study on agentic journal entry testing, we demonstrate the practical application of these systems. Our findings highlight how AI agentic audit workflows, characterised by iterative refinement and specialised tool use, can execute advanced audit procedures. We envision this work as an initial step towards the adoption of agents in auditing and advocate for the exploration of AI agents in this domain.

Keywords: artificial intelligence, artificial intelligence agents, large language models, financial auditing, accounting information systems, journal entry testing
