Abstract

Income inequality remains a critical determinant of health disparities in the United States, with evidence consistently showing that widening economic gaps contribute to inequities in healthcare access, quality of life, morbidity, and mortality (Lawanson, Abu-Halimeh, & Ajiferuke, 2025). This systematic review synthesizes empirical findings from peer-reviewed studies published between 2000 and 2025 to assess the extent to which income inequality shapes health outcomes across different demographic groups. Data were extracted from major databases including PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, following PRISMA guidelines. A total of 76 studies were included, focusing on outcomes such as chronic disease prevalence, mental health conditions, maternal and child health, and life expectancy differences. The findings reveal that higher income inequality, often measured through the Gini coefficient, is significantly associated with worse health outcomes, particularly in low-income populations and racial/ethnic minorities. Furthermore, regions with greater disparities exhibit limited access to preventive services and higher disease burdens. Mechanisms identified include psychosocial stress, neighborhood disadvantage, and restricted access to healthcare and healthy living conditions. Importantly, policy-level interventions such as Medicaid expansion, minimum wage policies, and targeted social safety nets show potential in mitigating adverse effects. This review underscores the urgency of addressing structural determinants of health by reducing income inequality, promoting equitable access to healthcare, and fostering community-based interventions. The results highlight that tackling income inequality is not only an economic imperative but also a vital public health strategy to reduce persistent disparities across the U.S. population (Lawanson, Berleant, & Ajiferuke, 2025).
