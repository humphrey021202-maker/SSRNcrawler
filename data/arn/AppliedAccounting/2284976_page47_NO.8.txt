Abstract

This paper analyses the role of the French research tax credit (Crédit d’impôt recherche, CIR) in the French innovation policy mix by putting it into the international context. After comparing the French situation to other countries with two indicators – innovation performance and stimulating business R&D – and analysing the structure of CIR beneficiaries, we argues that under the current budget constraint, there are rooms of adjustment to reduce the cost CIR and to increase its efficiency. Meanwhile, we suggest that further empirical studies will help to fully assess the impact of CIR within the French innovation policy mix.

Keywords: innovation policy mix, tax incentives, French Research Tax Credit (CIR), business R&D, innovation performance
