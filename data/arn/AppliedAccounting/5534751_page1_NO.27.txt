Abstract

This study examined whether undergraduate accounting programmes adequately prepare students for professional accountancy examinations, drawing on Expectancy-Value Theory and Self-Efficacy Theory as theoretical frameworks. Specifically, the study investigated the relationships between students’ perceptions of course relevance, exam preparation, self-efficacy, and time management, while also assessing differences across gender and age. Data analysis employed both descriptive and inferential statistics, including frequencies, percentages, means, standard deviations, standard errors of measurement (SEM), independent sample t-tests, and one-way ANOVA to test the study’s objectives. The findings revealed that students perceive their undergraduate courses as relevant to professional examinations, and this perception significantly influenced exam preparation, self-efficacy, and time management. While gender differences were not significant, age emerged as a differentiating factor, with younger students reporting stronger preparation and confidence, and older students perceiving higher course relevance. These results underscore the importance of aligning undergraduate curricula with professional exam requirements to enhance students’ motivation, confidence, and readiness. The study concludes that universities can improve professional exam outcomes by strengthening curriculum relevance and providing tailored support across demographic groups.

Keywords: Accountancy Exams, Self-Efficacy, Preparation, Time Management, and Accounting Programmes
