Abstract

This study looks at different types of industries, how much people trust them, and the information they share in their financial statements. It studies the relationship between stakeholders' trust and the transparency and quality of financial disclosures. It also evaluates things like trust among stakeholders, accurate disclosure of finances, the quality of reporting, known best practices, voluntary information, and if a company follows the rules. A quantitative survey was done with 100 people from manufacturing, finance, technology, and services, and it included input from financial managers, auditors, investors, and top managers. Responses were gathered through a standard Likert-scale survey, and these were then analysed with IBM SPSS. The researchers focus on stakeholder trust, following regulations, voluntary disclosure, transparency, and the quality of financial disclosure. According to the findings, stakeholders trust a company more when it follows the rules and adopts voluntary best practices, rather than when it is just transparent. It was found that Banking & Finance, IT/Technology, and other regulated sectors have higher quality financial disclosure than Manufacturing and Healthcare. The study underlines that trust from stakeholders can be built by not just following rules, but using frameworks specific to the sector and being proactive about being open. Following voluntary reporting, complying with regulations, and using best practices all serve to earn stakeholders' trust. Results from the study give insight into the way financial disclosure rules affect stakeholders and recommend ways to strengthen financial reporting in all industries.

Keywords: Financial Disclosure, Stakeholder Trust, Transparency, Regulatory Compliance, Industry Sectors, Financial Reporting
