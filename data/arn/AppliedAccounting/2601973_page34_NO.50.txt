Abstract

Failing to timely file the estate tax return, timely pay the estate tax, and properly report the values of the gross estate and related deductions can result in significant financial penalties not only to the estate, but to the personal representative and beneficiaries of the estate, as well. This article explores statutes and recent case law regarding issues involving valuation, penalties, and liability that can crop up when dealing with the federal estate tax.

Keywords: estate tax, valuation, penalties, executor liability, transferee liability
