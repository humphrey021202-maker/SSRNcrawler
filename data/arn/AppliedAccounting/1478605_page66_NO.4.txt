Abstract

Employers that offer defined contribution plans are aware of the delicate balance between giving plan participants much-needed information about investing and offering them investment advice-the latter means additional fiduciary liability under ERISA for the employer. Now a Department of Labor draft interpretive bulletin helps employers negotiate this tricky area.

Keywords: Department of Labor, pension plans, investment, ERISA
