Abstract

Current proposals to replace the U.S. foreign tax credit with an exemption for the income of foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies make timely a review of the basic analytics of taxation under the two systems. This brief note reviews the key relationships, highlighting some that are not always fully appreciated in policy discussions.
