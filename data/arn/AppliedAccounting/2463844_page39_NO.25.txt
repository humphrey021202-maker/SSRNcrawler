Abstract

Trust and control can have enforcing as well as deteriorating effects on managing relational and performance risk. This case study explores their interaction during alliance negotiations in the financial services industry in a Scandinavian setting. In particular, we investigate the interaction of trust in goodwill and competence, as well as the controls of output, behavior, and social nature.

Keywords: control; risk; trust

JEL Classification: M10
