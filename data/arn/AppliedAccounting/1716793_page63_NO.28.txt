Abstract

The paper analyzes the latest financial statements from Danish public limited companies declared bankrupt in 2008, studying how and to what extent tax loss carryforwards are recognized. The study shows that more than one third of the bankrupt companies have recognized a deferred tax asset. Large companies are more likely to recognize deferred tax assets, just as large companies better meet the disclosure requirements of IAS 12. Companies audited by upper-tier auditors are more likely to recognize deferred tax assets than companies audited by lower-tier auditors. The substantial recognition of deferred tax assets in bankrupt companies indicate that there are serious problems in practice regarding IAS 12’s requirement of an assessment of the probability of realization. The company’s auditors appear to play an important role in accounting for deferred tax, which may explain why other studies do not find that deferred tax assets are commonly used for earnings management. Overall, the results indicate the need for more consistent and complete accounting for deferred tax assets in order to facilitate comparability and transparency in financial reporting.
