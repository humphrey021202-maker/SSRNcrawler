Abstract

Introductory Accounting textbooks rarely devote adequate attention to the process of accounting standards setting. Usually the subject is addressed, if at all, only in a graduate seminar, and many students get through business programs with a rather hazy idea about Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), particularly its consensual basis. As Miller and Redding (1988) note, 'by its very nature, standards setting is very much a matter of politics' (p. xi).

Keywords: FASB, Accounting Theory, Standards Setting, GAAP, Political Economy, Institutions
