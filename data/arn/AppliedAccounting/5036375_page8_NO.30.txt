Abstract

There is little meaningful recognition of an accounting equity statement’s universal absence in today’s three prospective financial statements. However, like four historical primary financial statements and unlike the three prospective primary financial statements, four prospective primary financial statements validate prospective debit entries equal prospective credit entries. Does the remediation of an investments’ debits not equaling credits necessitate replacing traditional IRR/NPV valuations?  What if an IRR/NPV replacement elicits an investment architecture with a new benchmarking valuation metric; the new valuation metric is calculated from now available prospective equity statements. Would the new investment architecture’s benchmarking of active versus passive investments, ability to peer inside EBITDA Multiples, elimination of subjective investment valuation weighing and unification of micro and macroeconomic valuations collectively warrant replacing IRR/NPV?
