Abstract

This paper examines whether, and under what circumstances, tax incentives are the right policy tool to attract economic activity. It describes various types of tax incentives and factors that should be considered before their implementation. The paper also looks at certain elements of the legislative framework for tax incentives in the European Union, as competition to attract investment and concerns about its negative outcomes are particularly strong among countries whose economies are integrated. The paper concludes that it would be far more efficient to improve the investment climate and to remove non-tax impediments to investment before even considering the need for tax incentives.

Keywords: tax incentives, tax expenditure, European Union, tax competition

JEL Classification: K34
