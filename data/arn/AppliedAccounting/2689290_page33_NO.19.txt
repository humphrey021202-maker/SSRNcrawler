Abstract

Four states, California, Maryland, New York, and Oregon, have regimes for regulating otherwise unlicensed paid income tax return preparers. Each state program includes compulsory education and some standards of practice. The most rigorous programs are those of Oregon and New York, which also include qualification exams and criminal penalties. This article examines the four state programs in depth.
