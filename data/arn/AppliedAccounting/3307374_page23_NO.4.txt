Abstract

In this report, Adam Wallwork discusses how tax rules applicable to leveraged partnerships, facilitate investments by foreign persons in U.S. real estate and infrastructure through domestically-controlled real estate investment trusts (REIT). Domestically-controlled REITs remain one of the only vehicles for foreigners to invest in U.S. real estate or infrastructure without incurring significant U.S. tax, withholding and filing obligations under the 1980 Foreign Investments in Real Property Tax Act (FIRPTA). To mitigate these risks, foreign investors in U.S. real property increasingly invest in domestically-controlled REITs indirectly through leveraged partnerships because such partnership tax rules confer on partners advantages from basis increases in respect of partnership debt to tax-free contributions of encumbered property, which REIT shareholders cannot match. After exploring each of the two REIT umbrella structures through which practitioners estimate that 75 percent of domestically-controlled REITs are held, the report considers in this context how Treasury's recent bottom-dollar payment and disguised sale rules apply with respect to each such structure.
