Abstract

Through the Finance Act 2017, forty-six sections of the Income-tax Ordinance 1984 have been amended. But there are very few changes in individual taxation (for taxpayers with disability and manufacturer of tobacco products) and no changes in corporate tax rates. The revenue pressure on income tax due to deferring the implementation of the Value Added Tax and Supplementary Duty Act 2012 for two years has been addressed through a number of ways. But this year’s most significant changes regarding income tax is possibly the digitalization initiatives in Income Tax Department through system generated communications and electronic filing of documents.

Keywords: National Budget, Finance Act, Income tax
