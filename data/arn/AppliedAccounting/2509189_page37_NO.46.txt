Abstract

This paper has suggested that as we consider tax reform in 2014 and thereafter, we should revert to some of the positive features of TRA 86, updated to reflect increasing globalization. Specifically:

a. The top individual rate, the KG rate and the dividend rate should be set at 28%; b. The corporate rate should also be set at 28%; c. Corporations should be taxed on global income with no deferral or exemption.

These reforms are not enough to address our long-term deficit problem; they are designed to be revenue neutral overall, like in TRA 86. In the longer term we need a VAT, but that is a task that must wait for bolder political leadership than we currently appear to have.

Keywords: Tax Reform

JEL Classification: H26
