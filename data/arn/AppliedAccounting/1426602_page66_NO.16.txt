Surnamed Charitable Trusts: Immortalilty at Taxpayer Expense

Alabama Law Review, Vol. 61, Forthcoming

Posted: 1 Jul 2009

William A. Drennan

Southern Illinois University School of Law

Date Written: June 27, 2009

Abstract

Charitable trust law authorizes surnamed trusts, and provides no convenient mechanism to force a name change even hundreds of years after the founder's death. Tax law treats the use of a surname as harmless. A founder's ability to surname can provide a significant benefit to the founding family at the expense of the common good. This Article introduces the topic into the debate, provides new empirical evidence, and proposes a viable legislative response.

Keywords: private foundation, charitable trust

JEL Classification: K34
