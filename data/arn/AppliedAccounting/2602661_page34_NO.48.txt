Abstract

Getting the performance in auditing currently demands many requirements of real time management of many data sources and analysis dimensions, up to date characteristics, speed, flexibility, portability, suggestive power and reporting automation. This paper presents, using theoretical and practical arguments, the advantages of using data available on-line for reporting and audit activities. The novelty consists in using figures and examples enriched by references to interactive scenarios of “documentation-emulated application” constructed by the authors and also in describing a technique of transforming on-line data into on-line complex reports with dynamic and interactive behavior specific to Business Intelligence support technologies. This technique is symbolically named COL3D in this paper and accompanies a proposal to create a unique Romanian register of audit engagement (OL2RAM) for institutions financed by the state budget and/or by European funds, being on-line available and editable by authorized users.

Keywords: On-Line Form, Dynamic Dashboard, On- Line Dynamic Reporting, The OL2RAM Register, The COL3D Technique

JEL Classification: C61, D81, D83, M42
