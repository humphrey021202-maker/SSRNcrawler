Abstract

In Notice 2014-32, the Internal Revenue Service described changes that will be made to the Treasury regulations under Section 367(b) of the Internal Revenue Code addressing ‘‘Killer B’’ transactions (the Killer B regulations). As discussed in this article, a primary goal of Notice 2014-32 is to combat a cross-border acquisition structure typically used in connection with an inversion transaction through a series of changes to the Killer B regulations. In announcing these forthcoming changes, Notice 2014-32 effectively admits that the current regulations have failed to eliminate Killer B transactions from the marketplace. Furthermore, the notice confirms that the Killer B regulations have shortcomings that reflect the difficulty associated with drafting rules in this area.

Keywords: inversions, inversion transaction, Killer B, cross-border acquisitions, section 367(b), notice 2014-32

JEL Classification: K34, H25, E62
