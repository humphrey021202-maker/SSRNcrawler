Abstract

This article provides a detailed analysis of tenancy-in-common arrangements and shows how fixed-price put options to sell such interests undermine the classification of such arrangements as tenancies-in-common for federal income tax purposes. The article is reminder that there are limits to the types of terms that co-owners can adopt when they structure tenancies-in-common.

Keywords: section 1031, tenancy-in-common, drop-and-swap, put options, fixed-price put options
