Abstract

Accounting information is essential for the success of businesses around the world, as it translates various events into a common financial language. It uses formalized procedures for collecting and reporting data, creating a shared language that facilitates communication among members of an organization. This formalization simplifies information transmission, reducing the need for complex symbols and enhancing coordination among different functions involved in the decision-making process. The main aim of this study is to investigate the effect of accounting information systems on decision-making in the Sierra Leone Commercial Bank (SLCB). A mixed methods research approach was selected for this study. Questionnaires developed by the researcher were used to assess the level of accounting information systems and their impact on management decision-making. A 4-point Likert scale was employed, ranging from "Strongly Disagree" (1) to "Strongly Agree" (4), as it effectively measures perceptions, attitudes, values, and behaviors related to accounting information systems and management decisions. The gathered data was collected, coded into a computer, and statistically analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). The findings of the research revealed the following: Firstly, the Accounting Information System (AIS) plays a crucial role in supporting management decisions, particularly in resource allocation and performance evaluation. Secondly, while SLCB employs both computerized and manual AIS components, there is a clear need for further optimization of the computerized systems, particularly in data collection and financial analysis. Thirdly, the strong emphasis on system controls within SLCB demonstrates a solid foundation for AIS security. However, the identified vulnerabilities point to the necessity for continuous improvement in this area. Lastly, while the decision-making process at SLCB is generally effective with a slight emphasis on centralized decision-making, there is significant potential to enhance employee involvement and skill development within these processes These findings illustrate that SLCB has established a solid foundation in its use of AIS for decision-making. However, they also highlight specific areas where targeted improvements could significantly enhance the bank's operational efficiency and competitive position within the Sierra Leone banking sector.
