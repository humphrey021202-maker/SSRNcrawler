This paper investigates the relationship between National In-Country Value (ICV) certification and corporate sustainability in the United Arab Emirates. Quantitative data was collected using a survey instrument distributed to accountants. Respondents perceive a significant relationship between ICV and corporate sustainability. Company characteristics, including company legal ownership and type, determine the relationship between ICV and sustainability. The National In-Country Value (ICV) certification represents an innovative tool to boost local economic development and growth. This paper provides valuable guidance for managers, accountants, regulators, and policymakers to improve sustainability policies.
