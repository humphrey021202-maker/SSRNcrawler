Abstract

This article critiques IRS Chief Counsel Advice 201501011, in which the Internal Revenue Service asserted that a reinsurer could not claim an immediate deduction for the ceding commission paid in an indemnity retrocession transaction completed in connection with the acquisition of a life reinsurance business. As discussed in this article, this misguided conclusion should be rejected in view of its blatant disregard of sections 848(g) and 197(f)(5) of the Internal Revenue Code, the legislative history of section 197, the relevant provisions of the Treasury regulations under sections 197, 338, and 1060, and the prior analyses of the Internal Revenue Service.

Keywords: ceding commission, reinsurance, retrocession, applicable asset acquisition, specified insurance contracts

JEL Classification: G22, E62, K34, H25
