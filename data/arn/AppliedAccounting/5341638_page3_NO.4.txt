Abstract

This paper presents a comparative study of accounting for business combinations, consolidation, and group financial reporting under IFRS, Ind AS, and US GAAP, with a focus on developments from 2015 to 2025. Against the backdrop of substantial global merger and acquisition (M&A) activity, transparent accounting for goodwill, noncontrolling interests (NCI), and consolidation outcomes is essential for investor trust and regulatory scrutiny. Tracing the historical shift from pooling-of-interests to the nowdominant acquisition method, this study reveals substantial convergence between IFRS and Ind AS, while underscoring enduring differences such as the treatment of bargain purchases, options for NCI measurement, and explicit pooling requirements for common control transactions under Ind AS. Drawing upon accounting standards, regulatory reviews, empirical research, and illustrative cases like Tata Steel-Corus and Amazon-Whole Foods, the paper highlights practical challenges including fair value allocation of intangibles, judgments in control assessments, and rigorous goodwill impairment testing. The findings emphasize that, despite global harmonization, nuanced divergences continue to shape reported outcomes, necessitating careful analysis by preparers, auditors, regulators, and investors. This study contributes to the discourse on international accounting harmonization and corporate transparency, offering insights relevant to practitioners, scholars, and policymakers.
