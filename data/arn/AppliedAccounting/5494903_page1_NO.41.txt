Abstract

An inversion in the ratio of intangible assets to market value since the mid-1970s is often invoked as grounds for revising accounting standards relating to intangibles. We show that although intangible assets were approximately 20% of S&P 500 firms’ market value in 1975 and around 80% in 2020, describing this as an inversion from ‘20/80 to 80/20’ neglects the fact that the ratio was exceptionally low in 1975. Intangible assets represented a similar level (around 60%) of market value in 1965 as in 1990 and increased to around 80% in 2000. Although this evidence seems to suggest that accounting information about intangibles has become increasingly value irrelevant, we also show that incorporating forecast income statement data as part of a simple valuation approach produces estimates which closely approximate market value on average. Overall, the ‘inversion’ of the ratio of intangible asset value to market value is not as emphatic as is often claimed and therefore offers limited support for major changes to accounting for intangibles.

Keywords: Financial reporting, intangibles, market value.
