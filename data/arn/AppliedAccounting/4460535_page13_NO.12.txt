IFRS Accounting Standards and Comparability of Information

Date Written: May 26, 2023

Abstract

One of the main objectives of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) is to improve the comparability of financial reports internationally and is a reason jurisdictions abandoned their local GAAP. Contemporaneous comparability is affected by the clarity of the requirements and the choices available. The focus of my paper is cataloguing choice that is a consequence of the actions of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), including some factors not considered previously. I identify actions the IASB could take to reduce that choice, topics worthy of additional research and practical examples for educators that demonstrate the potential consequences of choice.

Keywords: Comparability, Contracting, Framework, IFRS, Transition

JEL Classification: G31, G32, G33, M21
