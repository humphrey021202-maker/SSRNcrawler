Abstract

Financial analysts are important players in the marketplace. Analysts’ reports, which include forecasts of earnings and stock recommendations, move market prices. Investors, both large and small, rely on the information in reports when forming their investment decisions. Given the relevance of financial analysts’ research, understanding whether their reports are biased is important. Despite an increase in market regulation, evidence suggests that analysts’ reports are biased. Research also finds that analysts’ bias increases when information uncertainty is high. Thus, investors should understand the possible dangers in blindly relying on research by financial analysts.

Keywords: behavioral finance, behavioural finance, financial analysts, market regulation, optimism, bias, information uncertainty
