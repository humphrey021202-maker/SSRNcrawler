Abstract

The aim of this paper is to study the elements characterizing fair value, which represents one of the most significant criterion that will impact on financial statements of Italian companies due to the adoption of International Accounting Standards/International Financial Reporting Standards (IAS/IFRS) by European enterprises, and to allow a comparative surveying with the concept of economic value, as it was defined in the Italian accounting literature, in connection with the possibility to find similar aspects, but substantial differences, too.

The study also analyzes, on the basis of empirical evidences founded out by a defined sample of companies listed in Stock Exchanges, the critical aspects of the accounting representation based on the adoption of the criteria above mentioned. This is especially relevant, nowadays, because of the recent project by International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) to promote these forms of representation, in particular the one called comprehensive income, with the aim of representing all the income components produced by enterprises, either realized and to be realized, as an instrument that will be able to make companies’ financial communication and disclosure more complete, as a fundamental element of corporate accountability.

Keywords: fair value, economic value, comprehensive income
