Abstract

On December 14, 2018, former CPA Marc Berger was sentenced to eight months in prison after a federal jury convicted him on three counts of aiding and abetting tax evasion for a client. Berger’s fall from grace serves as an important cautionary tale for all return preparers of the need to adhere to high standards of integrity in return preparation, even when faced with difficult clients with complicated business and financial matters.

Keywords: U.S. v. Marc Berge, Return Preparers
