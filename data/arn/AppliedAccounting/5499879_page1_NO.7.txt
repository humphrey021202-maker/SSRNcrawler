Abstract

Investor trust is central to the functioning of capital markets, yet its relationship with corporate social responsibility (CSR) remains underexplored. We investigate whether CSR performance affects the market’s reaction to earnings news. Our results show that firms with superior CSR performance exhibit stronger immediate market reactions to earnings surprises and significantly smaller post-earnings-announcement drift. We provide evidence that this effect arises from CSR enhancing investor trust, thereby reducing uncertainty and attenuating investors’ systematic underreaction to earnings information. Our findings hold even after controlling for financial reporting quality and corporate governance, establishing that the CSR effect is distinct. This study highlights that CSR performance enhances investor trust, ultimately leading to more efficient pricing of earnings information.

Keywords: Social Capital, Trust, Corporate Social Responsibility, Market Response To Earnings Announcements, Post-Earnings Announcement Drift

JEL Classification: M14, M41, G14
