Abstract

The Financial Reporting Act (FRA) has been passed in September 2015 and more than one and a half years have already been elapsed without the establishment of the Financial Reporting Council (FRC), although legal creation of FRC has already been in April 2016. This paper has highlighted a chronological development of the enactment of FRA 2015 and has outlined the functional responsibilities of FRC, the super regulator of accounting infrastructure. With the establishment of FRC, it will have far-reaching implications on accounting discipline and its followers. As the members of accounting profession, it is expected that we should be much more cautious not to be changed with the regulatory changes to be a prey of enforcement by the super regulator, rather we have to be "change-master" to master the changed regulatory landscape of accounting infrastructure in harnessing our real capability and competency in accounting as well as to prove ourselves as the members of the most dignified profession with high ethical standards being the protectors of public interest for all sorts of entities in case of providing the most valuable product (accounting information) to run an entity with utmost relevance and reliability.
