Where the Tax Reform Debate Should Start

Abstract

This article contends that there are points of overlap between the ideal conservative tax system, which would be consumption-based, and the ideal liberal system, which would be based on a Haig-Simons tax base. Full integration of the corporate and individual income taxes is one such area of agreement. Therefore, this is where tax reform should start.

Keywords: tax reform

JEL Classification: H20, K34
