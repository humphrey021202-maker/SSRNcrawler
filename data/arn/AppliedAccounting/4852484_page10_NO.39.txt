Abstract

Unstructured data are largely underexplored in equity investing due to their higher costs. The information content, as a result, remains largely untapped and offers an investment edge to discerning investors who are adept at extracting those investment insights. One particularly valuable unstructured data set is S&P Global Market Intelligence's earnings call transcripts. This publication, the third in the series (NLP I, NLP II), introduces new stock selection ideas in the areas of I) Topic Identification, II) Call Transparency and III) Call Sentiment using more advanced NLP techniques. The new signals complement the existing suite of signals that is offered in our Textual Data Analytics (TDA) product, an off-the-shelf NLP solution for both quantitative and fundamental analysts.
