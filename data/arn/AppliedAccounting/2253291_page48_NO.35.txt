Date Written: April 1, 2013

Abstract

Johnson argues that budgets prepared by the Office of Management and Budget and the Joint Committee on Taxation should use tax on internal rate of return (IRR) as the baseline for measuring tax expenditures and that departure from level-playing-field taxation of capital should be justified or repealed.
