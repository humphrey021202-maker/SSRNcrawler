Abstract

In this research paper, a sample of publicly listed enterprises found consecutively listed and chosen at random from the NYSE are analysed over a defined period of time using the most recent publicly available annual reports.

The list should be diversified enough to provide an interesting discussion and insight into the financial health of firms with large differences in operating revenue and income.

Keywords: NYSE, equities, research, steven, mckeon, investment, investing, porfolio, portfolio construction, analysis, document
