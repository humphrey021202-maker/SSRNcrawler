Abstract

In this paper, we examine the input-output efficiency of United Kingdom CPA firms using the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) approach. We find that a majority of CPA firms in the United Kingdom appear not to be efficient on a yearly basis, and we further find no evidence of persistent efficiency on a multi-period basis. The results of our study may serve as a yardstick for CPA firms interested in assessing their efficiency relative to their peers, and as a new gauge of CPA performance.

Keywords: CPA, United Kingdom, input-output efficiency

JEL Classification: M40, M41
