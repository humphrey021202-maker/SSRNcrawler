Abstract

The Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 mandated that the PCAOB focus on protecting the investor and public interests and restricted the auditing profession’s involvement in creating auditing standards. We explore the linguistic characteristics auditors use when participating in standard setting. Specifically, we examine the comment letters auditors submit on auditing standards to the PCAOB and SEC to understand how these professionals engaged in the tiered regulatory system of the past two decades. Leveraging a cross-sectional panel of 1,447 comment letters, our analysis reveals that auditors' comment letters convey more analytical thinking and clout and less spontaneous (i.e., authentic) language than the control group of issuers' financial reporting professionals. Interestingly, linguistic characteristics change across regulators. When addressing the SEC, we find no difference between auditors and issuers in their use of analytic language. However, auditors' comment letters exhibit a greater use of language demonstrating clout and a positive tone with the SEC than when they address the PCAOB. We discuss implications for future research.

Keywords: Auditing standard, standard setting, Writing style, Linguistic characteristics, PCAOB, SEC
