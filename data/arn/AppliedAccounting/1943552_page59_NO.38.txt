Abstract

Ambiguities in existing accounting standards yield unintended diversity in practice, diversity that must be corrected through clarifications from the FASB in a time- and effort-consuming feedback loop. Further, a wide gulf exists between the language of standard setters and the structured, purpose-driven framework utilized by standards users. We recommend using formalization, specifically pseudocode, to bridge these gaps between standard setters and practitioners. We present examples of the use of formalization, as well as a road map for future developments, discussing potential roadblocks and alternatives.

Keywords: formalization, accounting standards, pseudocode, ambiguity, standard setting, GAAP

JEL Classification: M41, M49
