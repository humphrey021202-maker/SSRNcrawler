Abstract

This study investigates the impact of blockchain technology adoption on the environmental performance of organizations, focusing on its role in improving sustainability reporting, reducing carbon emissions, and optimizing resource utilization. The study covers the period from 2014 to 2023, using data from 152 firms across eleven (11) industries that have integrated blockchain solutions into their operations. Employing a mixed-method approach, quantitative data was analyzed using panel regression models to assess the relationship between blockchain adoption and environmental performance indicators. The findings reveal that blockchain adoption significantly enhances ecological performance by increasing transparency in supply chains, reducing energy consumption inefficiencies, and facilitating compliance with environmental regulations. Specifically, firms leveraging blockchain for carbon tracking reported a reduction in emissions. The study's originality lies in its focus on blockchain as a technological enabler for environmental sustainability, bridging a critical gap in the existing literature by providing empirical evidence from diverse industries and emphasizing the role of technology in achieving sustainable development goals. These results have profound implications for policymakers, regulators, and practitioners aiming to integrate innovative technologies into environmental strategies.
