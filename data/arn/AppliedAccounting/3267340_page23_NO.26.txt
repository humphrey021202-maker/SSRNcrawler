Abstract

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 created substantial new tax benefits for taxpayers with taxable gain, if they make certain investments in so-called "qualified opportunity zones" (QO Zones). The QO Zone tax benefits generally include permanent tax exemption of up to 15% of the recognized gain and tax deferral of the remaining gain until 2026. In addition, the taxpayer's gain from selling its QO Zone investments after 10 years may be entirely exempt from tax. The article discusses some QO Zone tax issues, such as the mechanics of making the investments and the types of business activities permitted in the zones.
