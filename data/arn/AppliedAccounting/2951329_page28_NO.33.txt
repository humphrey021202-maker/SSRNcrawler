Abstract

This paper provides a brief overview of three countries, including background information, accounting, and capital markets. The countries represent three major world regions: India in southwest Asia, Singapore in the Pacific Rim, and South Africa in Africa. Each country plays a major economic role in its region of the world. The role of accounting is expected to have a major impact on viability of the country’s capital markets and future economic development. Some knowledge of these countries will be helpful to corporate accountants and internal auditors, who work in companies with multinational operations.

Keywords: IFRS, Capital Markets, India, Singapore, South Africa
