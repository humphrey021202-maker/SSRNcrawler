Abstract

Intercompany financing is a common feature in corporate structures across the Middle East, particularly in conglomerates and family-owned business groups. This paper examines the treatment of loan repayments by affiliates under the equity method of accounting, highlighting practical implications under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), specifically IAS 28, and related guidance. It also explores how these repayments affect investors' financial statements and considers disclosure and tax implications relevant to Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) markets.
