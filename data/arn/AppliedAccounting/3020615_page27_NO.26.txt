Abstract

The purpose of this review is to explore various approaches and perspectives that are currently being used by empirical studies reporting the impact of IFRS adoption in different jurisdictions around the globe. For this purpose to be better served, this study also presents at the outset an overview of the scope, objectives and current adoption status of IFRS. This study reviewed the literature on classifications of IFRS adoption studies with the view of deducting methodical frameworks outlining the dimensions that may warrant investigation for IFRS to be consented as a set of quality and global accounting standards. This study concludes that the success of IFRS as an international accounting standard depends on one hand in its technical quality economically yielding to both users and reporters of financial statements and on the other hand their acceptance across different jurisdictions despite their political, cultural and economic diversities.

Keywords: Accounting, Adoption, Approach, Convergence, Evaluation, Harmonization, IFRS, Impact, Standards, Status
