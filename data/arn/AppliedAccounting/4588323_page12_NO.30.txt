Abstract

Whilst many tax practitioners may be aware of the more straightforward forms of investing and trading cryptoassets, a more complex area of the crypto economy is Decentralised Finance (DeFi). DeFi applications offer new forms of financial products built upon blockchain technology. In this paper, several basic DeFi activities are examined for the Australian income tax consequences. Activities explored include setting up a wallet, airdropping, trading, becoming a liquidity provider in a liquidity pool, bridging, and staking. In doing so, the tax consequences arising are discussed, including contentious issues therein, related ATO guidance and data capturing capabilities. The paper concludes with some of the lessons learned.
