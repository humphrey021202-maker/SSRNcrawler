Abstract

Cryptoassets have attracted significant and growing attention from consumers, regulators and markets globally during recent years.

We observe that the current accounting frameworks all over the world, at least at first sight, lack any clear guidance on what accounting treatment may be acceptable for cryptoassets and in particular for cryptocurrencies. The same can be said for taxation, although most countries have issued some basic guidance over the past few years, there is still substantial ambiguity on several important questions about the taxation of cryptoassets and no international approach has been applied

Keywords: cryptoassets, cryptocurrencies, blockchain, tokens, token sale, token taxation

JEL Classification: M41
