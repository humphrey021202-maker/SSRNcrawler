Abstract

Pub. L. No. 115-97, the law formerly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA), added new section 1061 to require some carried interests to have a capital gain holding period of over three years (rather than the usual one year) to qualify for long-term capital gain tax rates. Treasury and the IRS released proposed regulations under section 1061 on July 31, 2020 In a previous article, we explained why some aspects of the proposed regulations may present problems for real estate investment trusts (REITs) and recipients of long-term incentive plan (LTIP) units in a REIT’s operating partnership (OP).

On January 7, 2021, Treasury and the IRS released draft final regulations under section 1061, which were published in slightly corrected form in the Federal Register on January 19, 2021. The final regulations provide taxpayers with some relief, particularly regarding the application of section 1061(d) to specified related-party transfers. In this article, we describe the changes in the final regulations that affect REITs and recipients of LTIP units.

Keywords: REIT, LTIP, 1061, carried interest, real estate, 1231 gains
