Abstract

This paper discusses the problems associated with the collection of audit evidence in an Information Technology (IT) environment. There has been a profound shift regarding the nature of audit evidence; more than 90% of the documents are now digital. A study was conducted years ago which showed that 80% of audits failed due to poor audit evidence ( Beasley, Carcello, & Hermanson, 2001). With the new age of computers, what’s the chance the percentage is even higher now?

Keywords: audit, evidence, SAS, risks, CAAT, information technology

JEL Classification: M49
