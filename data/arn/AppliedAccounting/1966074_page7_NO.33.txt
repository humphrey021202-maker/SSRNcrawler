Abstract

This article continues what has now become a comprehensive series examining the new U.S. reporting and withholding system for foreign account tax compliance. Part VI provides a new four-point analysis to determine if an FFI or USFI has a withholding tax liability for pass-through payments under Code Sec. 1471(b)(1)(D) or (3). It also addresses the first prong of this analysis regarding whether the FFI made a payment to a “ recalcitrant account holder” or “non–participating FFI,” and addresses the account identification procedures in detail.

Keywords: passthru payments, account identification procedures, qualified intermediary, FFI, NFFE, withholding tax, Notice 2011-53, Notice 2010-60, Notice 2011-34, EAG rules, USFI, IRS documentation, W-8, W-9, private bank account
