Abstract

Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), exemplified by ChatGPT and similar models, has rapidly infiltrated the realms of finance and accounting, revolutionizing traditional processes while presenting unique challenges. This paper delves into the multifaceted role and challenges faced by these generative AI technologies in the intricate landscape of financial and accounting sectors. In finance, ChatGPT streamlines customer interactions, offering personalized financial advice, aiding investment strategies, and facilitating real-time market analysis. It handles voluminous data swiftly, enhancing algorithmic trading, risk management, and fraud detection. In accounting, these AI models automate data entry, categorization, and report generation, reducing human errors and operational costs. They also assist in compliance tasks, ensuring adherence to evolving regulations, and enhance forensic accounting techniques. However, the integration of ChatGPT and similar AI in finance and accounting is not without challenges. Ethical dilemmas arise concerning data privacy, security, and biased decision-making algorithms. Ensuring these AI systems comply with industry standards and regulations while maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive financial data remains a significant hurdle. Moreover, there are concerns about the accountability of AI-driven financial decisions, requiring a delicate balance between human expertise and machine intelligence. Additionally, the constant evolution of financial markets demands adaptability and continuous learning from these AI systems, necessitating ongoing research and development efforts. This paper critically analyzes the evolving role of ChatGPT and similar generative AI in finance and accounting, shedding light on the transformative potential and the hurdles that need to be surmounted for these technologies to truly revolutionize the financial landscape.
