Abstract

Health-focused social enterprises (HFSEs) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have emerged as crucial actors in addressing persistent health inequities, providing affordable, accessible, and community-centered services that often complement fragile public health systems. Despite their innovation and impact, the scalability of HFSEs remains limited due to financial constraints, fragmented health markets, regulatory hurdles, and infrastructural deficits. Public–private partnerships (PPPs) offer a strategic pathway to overcome these barriers by combining the resources, legitimacy, and regulatory power of governments with the efficiency, innovation, and managerial expertise of the private sector. This paper explores the potential of PPPs as catalytic mechanisms to strengthen the scalability of HFSEs and achieve sustainable health outcomes in LMICs.The abstract first situates HFSEs within the broader global health context, highlighting their role in addressing service gaps in areas such as primary healthcare, diagnostics, maternal and child health, infectious disease control, and digital health innovation. While many HFSEs demonstrate strong pilot results and localized success, their expansion is often curtailed by limited access to capital, unpredictable demand, high unit costs, and lack of integration into national health financing systems. PPPs can mitigate these challenges by providing stable financing models, enabling access to infrastructure and technology, creating policy environments conducive to innovation, and integrating HFSEs into public health insurance and procurement mechanisms.Through an evidence-based analysis, the paper underscores the diverse forms that PPPs can take—ranging from output-based contracts, blended finance models, and outcomes-based financing to digital infrastructure partnerships and concession agreements. Each model carries distinct advantages in aligning incentives, distributing risks, and ensuring accountability. For example, outcomes-based contracts reward HFSEs for measurable health improvements, while blended finance structures reduce capital risk for investors and unlock new resources for expansion. Similarly, public provision of infrastructure or data platforms allows HFSEs to channel limited resources toward service delivery rather than fixed costs. By tailoring PPP structures to the health sector and local context, governments and development partners can maximize the scalability of HFSEs while safeguarding equity and quality.The abstract also identifies common obstacles to effective PPPs in LMICs, such as regulatory uncertainty, delayed payments, political instability, and weak monitoring systems. These challenges, if unaddressed, risk undermining trust, discouraging private investment, and weakening health impact. To address these issues, the paper proposes practical safeguards, including the use of escrow-backed payment mechanisms, adaptive regulatory sandboxes, independent verification systems, and open data standards for interoperability. Furthermore, the paper highlights the importance of embedding equity-sensitive safeguards into PPPs, such as differential tariffs for marginalized populations, geographic targeting for underserved areas, and grievance redress systems to ensure accountability to communities.Case illustrations from LMICs provide evidence that well-structured PPPs can significantly enhance HFSE scalability. For instance, diagnostic franchises supported through pooled procurement have achieved price reductions and faster turnaround times, while digital adherence technologies funded through outcome-based financing have improved treatment completion rates for tuberculosis. These examples demonstrate the replicability and adaptability of PPP approaches across diverse health subsectors.Ultimately, this paper argues that Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) should not be understood merely as financing mechanisms or contractual arrangements between governments and private actors, but rather as strategic platforms for integrating public accountability with the execution capacity, innovation, and efficiency of private enterprises. In the context of health-focused social enterprises (HFSEs) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), this reframing is particularly crucial, as it shifts attention from short-term project funding toward building durable ecosystems that support scale, resilience, and inclusivity. By embedding scalability principles into partnership design—such as predictable and sustainable financing models, rigorous systems of quality assurance, interoperability across platforms and sectors, and equity safeguards that prioritize vulnerable populations—PPPs can enable HFSEs to transcend the limitations of isolated pilot projects and fragmented interventions.
