Abstract

This article analyzes the major Kansas tax legislation enacted in May of 2012. It describes in detail the provisions of the new legislation and their operation, examines aspects of the new law that may be “gamed” by taxpayers, suggests provisions that should be clarified by statute or regulations, and finally explores some of the practical effects of the new law on State revenue and the distribution of the burden of taxation in Kansas.

Keywords: Kansas, income taxation

JEL Classification: K00, K34
