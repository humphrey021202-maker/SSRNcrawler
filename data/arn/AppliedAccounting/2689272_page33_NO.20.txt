Abstract

Over the past several years, the Internal Revenue Service has focused on enforcement in the international tax arena. This article discusses the U.S. taxpayer’s obligations to report their interests in, and transactions with, foreign partnerships. This article also discusses the specific reporting requirements, including IRS Forms 8865 and 8938, and penalties and other consequences of failure to timely file these forms.
