Abstract

The evolution of the criteria for considering an aid granted by the tax authorities as unlawful aid are examined in the present document. State aid Decisions, as well as, EUCJ Resolutions are analysed regarding tax ruling/ APAs granted in favour of certain multinational, as well as other specific fiscal measures, such as tax amnesties, anti-abuse rules, tax settlements, certain amortisation / depreciation rules or double tax conventions. Finally, it is intended to differentiate unlawful state aid from unfair tax competition.
