Abstract

Unlike historical Financial Statements, an investment opportunity’s prospective Financial Statements are never fully integrated and therefore misrepresent their investment’s valuation to some degree. Thus, to establish a valuation for an investment decision, an investment opportunity necessitates creating and weighing various valuations in an attempt to counterinfluence the various misrepresentations. Investment opportunities use valuation cultural influences to govern the formation and weighing of the various valuations. Does a new definitively structured valuation method challenge embedded valuation cultural influences and leave practitioners no longer subjectively weighing various valuations to reach an investment decision? The new definitively structured valuation method works within a trial balance structure where prospective transactional debits equal credits. The definitively structured valuation method’s homogenizing technique allows for the first ever fully integrated prospective Financial Statements, prevents ignoring a time-value axiom, resolves circular computational references and provides a user-designated reinvestment rate. The definitively structured valuation method uncovers macroeconomic Multiple type EBITDA valuations as nothing more than incomplete singular notation discounted-cash-flow valuations in need of upgrading. IRR and NPV valuations also show a need for upgrading.

Keywords: EBITDA, DCF, IRR, NPV, multiples, microfoundations
