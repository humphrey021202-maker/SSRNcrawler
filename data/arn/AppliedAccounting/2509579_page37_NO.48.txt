Abstract

Wikis have emerged as an important Web 2.0 technology for facilitating collaboration in organizations. Although researchers have begun to analyze their use in organizations and develop metrics to study their usage, there has been limited statistical analysis of use data. In addition, much of the empirical analysis of wikis is based on Wikipedia. This paper mitigates those limitations in the literature by examining data generated from a large consulting organization, Accenture, to statistically analyze the relationships between different use variables.

Keywords: Wiki, Wiki Use Metrics, Knowledge Management, Consulting Firms, Web 2.0, Statistical Analysis

JEL Classification: C20, L86
