Abstract

Analysis of the current state of the timely, voluntary disclosure of previously undeclared foreign financial accounts and assets. The voluntary disclosure programs offer reduced income tax and foreign account reporting penalties in exchange for taxpayers voluntarily coming into compliance before the IRS is aware of their prior tax and financial account reporting indiscretions.

Keywords: FBAR, OVDI, IRS, foreign account, UBS, OVDP
