Abstract

This past decade has seen a stark decline in business school undergraduates majoring in accounting. We help explain this decline by empirically showing that technological development, and corporate software investment in particular, is associated with lower employment and wage growth for accounting majors than for other business majors, especially finance. Cross-sectional tests point to these findings resulting from differences in demand for human capital associated with different college majors. As the wage gap between finance and accounting majors grows, fewer students subsequently choose an accounting major and more choose a finance major. Our findings illustrate the utility of incorporating labor market demand factors into analyses of wages and their link to enrollments.
