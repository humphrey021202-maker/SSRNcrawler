Abstract

Audit academia stands at a defining crossroads. As AI accelerates, firms disengage from research, and higher education faces structural strain, audit scholars must decide: will we lead the field—or quietly fade into deeper irrelevance? This paper argues that audit academia must reclaim its role as a meta-profession—one that critiques, legitimates, and instructs the field from an independent, meaning-making position. Drawing on professional theory and recent disruptions, the paper presents a model centered on three core functions: enhancing audit practice, legitimizing audit services, and educating future auditors. It challenges audit scholars to move beyond incrementalism, embrace bold normative inquiry, and prepare the profession for a future shaped by AI, shifting societal expectations, and institutional flux. Our role is not to mirror the profession’s present—but to help define its future.

Keywords: audit academia, meta-profession, research relevance, AI in auditing, legitimation
