Abstract

This study examines how auditor rotations affect Key Audit Matters (KAMs) in audit reports, using data from 45 companies listed on the Palestine Exchange (2018–2023). It finds that firm rotations significantly influence KAMs, while partner rotations have minimal impact. The results highlight the role of institutional frameworks and professional judgment in audit practices, contributing to the debate on mandatory firm rotation policies. These insights are particularly relevant for emerging markets like Palestine, where evolving regulatory structures and the interplay between global standards and local contexts create unique challenges for auditing practices.

Keywords: Auditor rotation, Key Audit Matters (KAMs), Audit quality, Palestine Exchange, ISA 701, Financial Reports
