Abstract

Astute investors have shifted their attention to explore the information content in unstructured data sets to differentiate their alpha. S&P Global Market Intelligence’s earnings call transcripts data is one such example that may offer that differentiated source of alpha. In this paper, we explore and highlight a number of sentiment- and behavioral- based alpha insights first introduced in our NLP primer. This work provides empirical support by enumerating the profitability of those insights in the U.S. market.
