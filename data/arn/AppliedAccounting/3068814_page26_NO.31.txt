Abstract

The Article argues that amounts realized in life should not disappear because of step-up in basis at death, even when Congress has enacted nonrecognition provisions that allow the tax to be deferred. The proposal is the third of three Shelf Projects designed go prune back the basis step-up under section 1014.
