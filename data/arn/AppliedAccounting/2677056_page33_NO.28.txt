Abstract

The central goal of this article is to provide nonprofessional investors with a deeper understanding of the impact of accrual accounting on earnings quality. Improving nonprofessional investors’ understanding of earnings quality is essential to the capital market, as they have been found to own nearly one-third of all outstanding stock (Bogle 2005), a number which anecdotally has increased due to employer-directed compensation plans and online stock trading platforms. Following a presentation of the importance of accruals in the earnings process, the framework discusses various earnings management practices that nonprofessional investors should consider when evaluating earnings quality.

Keywords: Earnings Management, Nonprofessional Investors
