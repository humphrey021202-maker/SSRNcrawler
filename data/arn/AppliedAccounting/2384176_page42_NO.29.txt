Abstract

As immigration reform politics heats up, there are regular reminders that aliens in an "amnesty" plan would have to pay federal taxes previously ignored or evaded. Based on extensive research the author finds this back taxes plan likely to be more symbolic than practical, and sees little possibility for any extensive filing or delinquent federal income tax returns or payment of the taxes.

This paper focuses on a prosecution which highlights the scope of the problem and the difficulties of crafting any remedy to the wide spread evasion of federal income taxes, identity theft, and document forgery.

Keywords: illegal aliens, undocumented workers, immigration amnesty, federal income tax evasion, identity theft, document fraud
