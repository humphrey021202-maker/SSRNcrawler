Abstract

Despite the importance of payroll taxes, and the clear defects in the rules, legislative proposals for change are limited, addressing primarily the lack of parity between a small service business carried on by an S corporation and directly or through a partnership. This report argues for more fundamental reform, such as the integration of payroll taxes and the personal income tax.

Keywords: payroll taxes

JEL Classification: K34
