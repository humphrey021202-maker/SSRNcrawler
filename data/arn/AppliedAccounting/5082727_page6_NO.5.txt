Abstract

This study evaluates the impact of effective internal control systems on the financial and operational performance of public universities in Sierra Leone, with a specific focus on the Ernest Bai Koroma University of Science and Technology (EBKUST). As public universities increasingly encounter accountability, transparency, and efficient resource management challenges, robust internal control systems have become essential for ensuring financial integrity and operational efficiency. This research aims to provide empirical evidence on how well-structured internal control frameworks contribute to improved performance in financial stewardship and overall institutional governance within EBKUST. The objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of internal control systems at EBKUST and their role in enhancing financial performance. Specifically, the study seeks to (1) explore how strong internal control systems influence the university's financial performance and (2) identify the primary beneficiaries of a well-implemented internal control system within the institution. To gain an in-depth understanding of the impact of internal controls on financial performance at EBKUST, a mixed-method approach was utilized, combining a cross-sectional survey design with interviews. The study population consisted of 187 staff members from EBKUST, and a census technique was employed for the quantitative aspect of the research. Data gathered from the survey was analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software. The results were presented using various statistical tools, including graphs, pie charts, and tables. Descriptive statistics were utilized to provide a clear overview of the data. The findings revealed that from the establishment of EBKUST, the internal controls in place were considered effective and satisfactory. This research also offers recommendations for enhancing internal control systems, aiming to foster greater efficiency and improve the financial health of public universities in Sierra Leone.
