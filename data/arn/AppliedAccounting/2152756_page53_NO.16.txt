Abstract

In spite of the prominent and elaborate treatment accorded the subsections under ss. 1.482-9 and 1.482-4 of the Internal Revenue Code, an in-depth exploration of the above provisions unearth a surprising similarity which if drilled further reveals a bluriness between the two provisions. Thus depending on the method employed in the assessment of arm's length transactions in services as well as transfer of intangibles, the result of establishing transfer pricing sometimes turn out to be the same.
