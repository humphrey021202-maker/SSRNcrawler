Abstract

During the past few decades, accounting and finance researchers, both academic and investment industry researchers have been interested in analysts’ valuation approaches and models determining the intrinsic value of an ownership stake, analysts’ target price, earnings forecasts, valuation errors and stock recommendation. This survey examines publicly available articles based on accepted valuation theory, that explore this issue to determine researchers’ methods of studying this process. This survey has found that few researchers study analysts’ valuation processes from the sell-side analyst approach. Instead, many use the approach of empirical studies (based on elements of analyst reports and interviews). This research suggests the need to approach the valuation process from the sell-side analyst approach, for example, by investment research report as it shares lots of information that better serves society and economies to grow.

Keywords: Security Analysis, Financial Analyst, Sell-Side Equity Analyst, Equity Valuation, Valuation Errors, Information Uncertainty, Stock Recommendations, Valuation Approaches, Valuation Model
