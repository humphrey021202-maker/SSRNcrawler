Abstract

The persistent fragility of Sierra Leone's external sector underscores the importance of understanding the macroeconomic factors shaping the country's Balance of Payments (BoP). Despite considerable attention in the literature to BoP dynamics in developing economies, limited empirical evidence exists for postconflict economies such as Sierra Leone. This study addresses this gap by examining the macroeconomic determinants of Sierra Leone's BoP using annual data spanning 1980-2020. The Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) bounds-testing approach, as developed by Pesaran, Shin and Smith (2001), is employed to capture both short-and long-run relationships between the BoP and key explanatory variables: real Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), real interest rates, the Official Effective Exchange Rate (OEEXR), and the External Balance on Goods and Services (EBGS). 2 The empirical results reveal that real interest rates and exchange-rate fluctuations exert statistically significant effects on the BoP in both the short and long run. Conversely, FDI is found to have a negative association with the BoP, suggesting that inward investment is closely linked to import-intensive activities and the repatriation of profits, thereby exacerbating external sector vulnerabilities. Real GDP and the EBGS, while important macroeconomic aggregates, exhibit relatively weaker and less consistent impacts within the model specification. These findings have important policy implications. To enhance external sustainability, Sierra Leone should prioritise exchange-rate stability through prudent monetary management, complemented by structural reforms aimed at diversifying the export base. Moreover, targeted FDI policies are required to channel investment into sectors with stronger domestic linkages and lower import dependence. Such measures are essential for improving BoP performance, reducing external imbalances, and strengthening macroeconomic resilience.
