Abstract

This article presents a comprehensive review and critical analysis of the global adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) over the past 25 years (2000–2025). Its key objective is to analyze how IFRS evolved into the dominant global accounting standard, why countries chose to adopt or adapt it, the forms this adoption has taken (full, converged, or partial), and the benefits and challenges that have emerged along the way. Drawing on a wide range of academic research, regulatory reports, and institutional publications from bodies such as the IFRS Foundation, World Bank, and OECD, the article constructs a detailed narrative of IFRS’s global journey, offering both historical context and forward-looking insights.

The historical trajectory is traced from the formation of the IASB in 2001, through the critical endorsement by IOSCO, to the European Union’s pivotal regulatory moves in 2005 that created a critical mass for global uptake. The article classifies IFRS adoption by countries’ economic development level, geographic region, and adoption type, providing a structured framework that captures the diverse ways in which IFRS has been integrated into national financial reporting systems. It also critically examines how national regulatory authorities, standard-setters, and political pressures have shaped each country’s approach, especially the use of “carve-outs” (omitting certain IFRS provisions) and “carve-ins” (adding local adaptations).

A major contribution of the article is its assessment of the key motivations driving IFRS adoption worldwide. Six principal drivers are identified: (1) the globalization of capital markets, (2) the desire to attract foreign investment and lower the cost of capital, (3) international regulatory pressure from organizations like IOSCO, G20, and the World Bank, (4) market and investor demand for greater comparability and transparency, (5) regional economic integration efforts (such as those led by the EU, ASEAN, and Mercosur), and (6) the need to modernize domestic accounting systems. Empirical evidence reviewed suggests that IFRS adoption has generally led to increased foreign investment, reduced home bias among investors, and lowered equity capital costs, particularly in countries with strong enforcement mechanisms.

The article critically evaluates the challenges faced during the IFRS transition, highlighting that while the anticipated benefits are significant, they come with substantial difficulties. These include the legal and regulatory reforms needed to embed IFRS in national laws, the technical complexity and expertise gap that strains local accounting professions, cultural and institutional resistance (especially where IFRS’s Anglo-American roots clash with local or religious traditions), the need for extensive training and IT system upgrades, and persistent enforcement challenges, especially in emerging and developing economies where formal adoption does not always guarantee effective application.

The article’s key finding is that although IFRS has successfully established a near-global reporting framework, its effectiveness varies greatly depending on local conditions, particularly the strength of enforcement and the degree of alignment between national adaptations and the global standard. It warns that without robust implementation, IFRS adoption risks becoming more of a symbolic gesture than a substantive improvement in reporting quality.

Finally, the article looks ahead, emphasizing the rising importance of the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) and the global push to extend IFRS principles to sustainability and ESG reporting. It argues that the lessons learned from the IFRS journey—especially the need to balance global consistency with local realities—will be critical for the success of future sustainability reporting initiatives under the IFRS umbrella.
