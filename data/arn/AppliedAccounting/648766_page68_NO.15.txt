Ethical Issues in Outsourcing Accounting and Tax Services

10 Pages Posted: 2 Feb 2005

Robert W. McGee

Fayetteville State University - Department of Accounting

Abstract

Outsourcing has been criticized as a practice that destroys jobs and praised as a way to cut costs and remain competitive. The accounting profession has utilized outsourcing to avail itself of expertise that is not available within the firm and to cut the cost of offering a variety of accounting and tax services. The practice has raised some ethical questions about integrity, objectivity, disclosure and client confidentiality. The AICPA Professional Ethics Executive Committee has issued two new ethics rulings and revised a third ethics ruling to address these issues. The new rules take effect July 1, 2005. This paper discusses these rulings and the effect they will have on accounting practices

Keywords: Outsourcing, contracting out, accounting services, tax services, ethics
