Abstract

This study investigates whether auditors select matters that involve especially challenging, subjective, or complex (“sophisticated”) judgment as critical audit matters (CAMs). We also examine whether CAM topics involving more sophisticated judgment are more likely to be persistent. We find that auditors do select topics that involve more sophisticated judgment as CAMs, but whether their selections are consistent with expectations varies across CAM topics. We also find that auditors report fewer CAMs than expected on a high percentage of engagements, providing confirmatory evidence that auditors are not disclosing all the CAM topics that might be expected. Finally, CAMs involving more sophisticated judgment are significantly more likely to persist in the subsequent year. Our study offers timely insights into auditor decision-making regarding CAM topic selection, amid rising rates of PCAOB inspection deficiencies related to CAMs, investor concerns about decreasing numbers of CAMs, and continued vigilance by standard setters.

Keywords: Audit reports, Accounting policies, Textual analysis, Critical audit matters
