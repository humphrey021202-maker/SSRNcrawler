Abstract

More than 20 years ago, Professor Herbert Hax (1989) derived the basic principles for measuring performance from the two conflicting demands that the ascertainable profit in a given period should be bound up with the effect of management decisions, and should also not be able to be manipulated. These basic principles determine how the cash flows of an investment project are allocated over time. In this paper, credit risk accounting – in accordance with IFRS and HGB – will, for the first time, be investigated with regard to its compliance with Herbert Hax’s basic principles for measuring performance.

Keywords: accounting for credit risks, expected loss approach, dynamic provisioning, incurred loss approach, performance measurement
