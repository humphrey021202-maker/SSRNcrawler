SME Accounting Requirements: Basing Policy on Evidence

ICAEW, 2015

41 Pages Posted: 15 Dec 2015

Brian Singleton-Green

Independent

Date Written: December 14, 2015

Abstract

The report looks at the costs and benefits of regulating SMEs' financial reporting, at why SMEs may require a different regime from other businesses, and at what research can tell us about these questions. It concludes that the evidence available to date is insufficient to develop policies that are soundly based, and that a substantial programme of research is needed.

Keywords: Audit, financial reporting, regulation, SMEs

JEL Classification: G32, K22, M41, M42, M48
