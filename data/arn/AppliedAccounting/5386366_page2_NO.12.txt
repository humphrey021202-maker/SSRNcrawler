Abstract

This paper provides a comprehensive examination of share buybacks as a financial strategy, combining global perspectives with an in-depth analysis of the Indian regulatory environment. It traces the evolution of buybacks from a legally constrained practice to a widely accepted corporate payout mechanism, highlighting the pivotal role of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 10b-18 (1982) in creating a "safe harbor" framework. The study contrasts international practices-particularly the flexible, open-market orientation in the United States-with India's stringent, disclosure-driven regime that prioritizes creditor and minority shareholder protection. It outlines key regulatory provisions in India under the Companies Act, 2013, and SEBI Buyback Regulations, including the 25% capital cap, 2:1 post-buyback debtequity limit, one-year completion requirement, and minimum utilization thresholds. The paper also examines execution methods-open-market repurchases, tender offers, Dutch auctions, and accelerated share repurchases-detailing their operational and market impact characteristics. Empirical insights highlight consistent positive announcement effects, driven by undervaluation signaling and capital structure optimization motives. Case studies, notably of Tata Consultancy Services, illustrate regulatory compliance, shareholder participation patterns, and route selection under evolving SEBI norms. The analysis concludes that while buybacks serve as an effective capital allocation tool, their design and regulation significantly influence fairness, market perception, and corporate governance outcomes. Policymakers are urged to balance flexibility with safeguards to ensure buybacks align with long-term value creation rather than short-term managerial objectives.
