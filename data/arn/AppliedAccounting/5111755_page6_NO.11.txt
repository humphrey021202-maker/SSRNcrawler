Abstract

An important contemporary policy debate relates to whether climate risk significantly impacts a firm’s financial performance. We examine how both public and private firms are financially affected by severe weather events and present three key findings. First, a severe weather event reduces 1.3% of an affected public firm’s market capitalization, on average. Second, the stock price impact is concentrated in specific industries and disaster types, and is attenuated for firms that disclose climate risks. Third, private companies are particularly susceptible to negative impacts on local operating performance, especially in certain industries. However, private firms show greater resilience when supported by government aid or when geographically diversified. We caution policymakers on disclosures aimed at regulating public firms’ disclosure of climate risks while the disproportionate financial impact of severe weather events potentially affects private firms.
