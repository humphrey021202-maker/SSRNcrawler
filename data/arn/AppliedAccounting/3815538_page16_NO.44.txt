Abstract

Layers between the level of the administrative apparatus and the level of management are increasing in relation to the company's activity. In the conditions of complex organizational structure and rather multilevel mechanism of management, problems with information flows are emerging that affect the coordination of decisions between the company units and the possibility of erroneous or contradictory management decisions. Leadership faces difficulties arising from the process of controlling, which promotes cases of fraud and misuse of position among company employees when performing their duties. Owners and management of the company rise strategic goals, tasks and decisions in front of the company personnel. Personnel, for various reasons, do not always fulfill management’s assignments, and the management because of the lack of time for control, cannot take appropriate decisions and detect the short comings in the work process in a timely manner. As it is known, the level of reliability of the chain depends on its weakest link. Often, control in the management of the corporation is the weakest link. Thus, along with the increase in the volume of corporation, it is difficult to manage its management process, which leads to a control crisis. The purpose of this research is to define approaches and control measures to the internal control and audit system in the economic entity, which is a key function of internal audit. The methodological basis of the research was provided by the papers of Georgian and foreign scientists dedicated to the internal control of the corporation and specifically to the internal audit. Key Findings are developing a set of documentation for performing control procedures that will reduce the time required for calculations and increase object verification accuracy. Implications for future research should be specific and they should be justified; future research areas are systematic analysis of audit and its development directions.
