Targeted Partnership Allocations Part II

Abstract

Although targeted allocations are now the most common type of allocations in partnership agreements, the IRS has never issued specific guidance regarding the use of targeted allocations. Targeted allocations involve a partnership’s liquidating not in accordance with partner capital accounts but, instead, in accordance with a negotiated distribution waterfall. When partnership agreements contain both targeted allocations and preferred return provisions, in certain situations, it is unclear whether the purported preferred return should be treated as a guaranteed payment, as a capital shift among the partners, or as an allocation of partnership profits. It remains uncertain whether targeted allocations can have economic effect under Sec. 704(b) and, thus, will be respected and can be relied upon to satisfy certain regulatory safe harbors that require partnership allocations that have substantial economic effect.
