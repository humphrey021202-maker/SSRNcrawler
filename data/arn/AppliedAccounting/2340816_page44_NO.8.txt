Abstract

This paper examines Australia’s 2009 Henry Review recommendations on small business taxation. In doing so this paper analyses these recommendations having regard to the issue of defining a small business and by examining the various rationales that are commonly extended for such concessions. Notwithstanding these rationales for these tax concessions, such concessions should be used sparingly. Defining a small business is problematic. Tax concessions generally contribute to complexity, inefficiency, inequity and damage fiscal adequacy. This paper submits direct targeted government grants are better alternative to support both small business and the wider economy.

Keywords: smal business, income tax, defining small business, tax policy, grants
