Abstract

Financial ratios are generally used to measure the firm’s economic and financial performance but their representation is not framed within an integrated framework. In the present paper I follow a different approach where ratios are not a direct measure of financial performance but rather the quantitative representation of operating choices over asset structure, financial and cost structure and pricing, and by setting them up into one single framework we can highlight the how those choices drive economic and financial results.

Keywords: Financial Ratios, Financial Statements, Budgeting
