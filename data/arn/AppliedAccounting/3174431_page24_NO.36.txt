Abstract

Blockchain is seen as revolutionary or incremental change technology. Very often in the existing literature the double-entry bookkeeping is mentioned as a business case for blockchain, which enables major efficiency gains by distributed technology and elimination of traditional intermediaries such as auditors or banks. Our study summarizes the existing literature.

Keywords: Blockchain, Digital Reporting, XBRL, Distributed Ledgers, Taxonomy

JEL Classification: 42
