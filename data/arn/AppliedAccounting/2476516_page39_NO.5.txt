Abstract

This article summarizes and comments on regulations that would redefine real property for purposes of the real estate investment trusts rules; and it argues that there should be more guidance on these and similar issues to close the gap between private letter rulings and published guidance affecting REITs and publicly-traded partnerships in the natural resources sector.

Keywords: Real property, REITs, publicly-traded partnerships
