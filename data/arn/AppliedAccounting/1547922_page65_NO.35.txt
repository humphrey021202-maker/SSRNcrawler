Abstract

The year 2008 marked the 50th anniversary of the enactment of Section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, which provides a special type of tax favored retirement arrangement available to certain employers. Revisiting a previous article by the same author, this article provides a comprehensive review of the rules governing 403(b) plans, as well as recent developments in the rules' application. Topics covered include: important 403(b) plan rules; the major remaining differences between 403(b) plans and qualified plans; reform proposals; and whether the retention of section 403(b) plans can be justified on policy (as opposed to historical) grounds.

Keywords: Section 403(b), Internal Revenue Code, Qualified Plans, Retirement

JEL Classification: M44
