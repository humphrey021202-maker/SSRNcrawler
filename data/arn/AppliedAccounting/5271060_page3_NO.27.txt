Abstract

This chapter examines the impact of generative AI on healthcare accounting information systems, focusing on Revenue Cycle Management (RCM). Through analysis of Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) sections from 14 US hospitals’ 10-K reports (2021–2023) and several scenarios utilizing ChatGPT and Claude AI, it demonstrates AI's potential to streamline RCM processes including appointment scheduling, patient registration, claims generation, billing, payment collection, data analytics, and fraud detection. The chapter discusses key machine learning algorithms for healthcare RCM, such as Random Forest for predicting no-shows, Gradient Boosting for claims denial prediction, and Neural Networks for fraud detection. It outlines a comprehensive API architecture for integrating AI with existing Electronic Health Records (EHR) and RCM systems, detailing components like API Gateway, Microservices, and Data Transformation Layer. The data flow between AI and legacy systems is illustrated, showing how information moves through various components. AI system training and validation processes specific to healthcare RCM are covered, including data preparation techniques and model evaluation metrics. Challenges of AI implementation, such as data quality, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) privacy concerns, and the need for human oversight, are addressed. The chapter concludes that the successful adoption of generative AI in healthcare accounting requires collaboration between healthcare leaders and EHR and RCM vendors to enhance financial stability and improve patient outcomes.
