Abstract

This article uses a hypothetical dialogue between a tax adviser and an exchanger to show that the section 1031 qualified use requirement does not impose a holding period requirement and that suggestions to the contrary appear to be based solely on perceptions of the likelihood of audit or the issue being raised on audit, which factors are prohibited in giving tax advice.

Keywords: section 1031, tenancy-in-common, drop-and-swap, qualified-use requirement, investment purpose, held for productive use in a trade or business
