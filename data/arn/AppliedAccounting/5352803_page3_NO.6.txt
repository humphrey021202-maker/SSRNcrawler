Abstract

This study conceptualises professional identity formation in accounting education as a dynamic and interpretive process shaped by the interplay of institutional design and individual sensemaking. By integrating Mezirow’s (1991, 2000) transformative learning theory with Ashforth and Schinoff’s (2016) sensemaking framework, we explore how scaffolded reflection in a work-integrated learning context facilitates various trajectories of identity development. Drawing on a rich dataset of reflections from second-year accounting students over six months, we trace identity construction as a recursive process of sense-breaking, sense-giving, and sense-making. Findings reveal substantial heterogeneity in outcomes, ranging from surface-level compliance to integrated personal and professional alignment. Instead of supporting a linear or uniform view of professional development, the data highlight the role of personal values, prior experiences, and relational resources in shaping student responses to disorienting dilemmas. For some, reflective tasks prompted deep re-evaluation and strategic action, while for others, identity work was more tentative, fragmented, or instrumental. By mapping how pedagogical interventions interact with students' evolving self-understandings, the study contributes a process-oriented model of professional identity development that balances structural intent with interpretive agency. This work offers theoretical insight and practical guidance for designing learning environments that support authentic, adaptive professional growth in accounting and beyond.
