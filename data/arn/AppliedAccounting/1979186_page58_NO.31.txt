Abstract

When a leaving shareholder normally has his or her shares redeemed by the corporation, he or she is taxed. However, when the shareholders of a closely-held corporation are a husband and wife that are in the midst of a divorce, the application of the tax consequences of Internal Revenue Code (IRC) section 1041’s “on behalf of” phrase results in inconsistency and uncertainty because some courts have taxed the leaving shareholder, others have taxed the remaining shareholder, and at least one has taxed neither. This author suggests completely repealing IRC section 1041 and allowing redemption to proceed under corporate tax law.

This article first discusses the tax consequences of stock redemptions under situations not involving a divorce, and thus no application of IRC section 1041. Depending on the circumstances of the redemption, the redemption may be taxed as a dividend, as a capital gain under IRC section 301 and subject to the exclusion under IRC section 1202, or as a distribution in exchange for stock under IRC section 302. Under non-divorce redemptions, the leaving shareholder will usually meet the requirements of IRC section 302 and have the redemption taxed as a capital gain. Unless there is a constructive dividend, the remaining shareholder will normally have no tax liability.

This article then discusses the creation, application, policy, and congressional intent behind IRC section 1041 and its regulations. Specifically, Temporary Treasury Regulation section 1.1041-1T(c) question and answer 9 (Q&A9)’s “on behalf of” phrase has been drafted in such a manner as to confuse the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and courts as to when IRC section 1041 actually applies. This article looks to the cases Arnes v. Commissioner, Hayes v. Commissioner, Blatt v. Commissioner, Read v. Commissioner, and Craven v. United States to show the inconsistent application of Q&A9’s “on behalf of phrase” and argues that the courts have frustrated the policies of IRC section 1041 and are heading toward whipsaw.

Lastly, the author reviews several solutions to the problems surrounding the “on behalf of” standard, including equating the “on behalf of” standard to the primary and unconditional obligation standard contained in Revenue Ruling 69-608, an amendment to the IRC allowing the spouses to choose who is taxed, and the complete repeal of IRC section 1041. In Appendix A the author provides her suggestion for the changes that must be made to the Temporary Treasury Regulations.
