Abstract

Instructors need materials such as instructions, cases, data, and software code in order to understand the basics of data analytics so that they can introduce the topic in their courses. We developed these materials to help instructors teach data analytics in their classes. These notes deliver the following learning outcomes: 1) Understand and use statistical concepts and techniques, and interpret statistical results. 2) Identify accounting and finance (A&F) specific applications of statistical concepts and techniques. 3) Identify practical sources of A&F data (e.g., stock market data, financial statement data, actual company specific sales and inventory data) and understand how data is structured. 4) Use the R statistical package to load/understand data, generate new variables (transform data), and perform appropriate statistical analysis on A&F data. 5) Interpret statistical results leveraging A&F knowledge.

Keywords: Data Analytics, Financial Accounting, Managerial Accounting, Finance, Statistics, R
