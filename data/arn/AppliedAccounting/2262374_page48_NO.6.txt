Abstract

We take up Cochrane’s (2011) challenge to identify the firm characteristics that provide independent information about average U.S. monthly stock returns by simultaneously including 94 characteristics in Fama-MacBeth regressions that avoid overweighting microcaps and adjust for data snooping bias. We find that while 12 characteristics are reliably independent determinants in non-microcap stocks during 1980-2014 as a whole, return predictability fell sharply in 2003 such that just two characteristics have been independent determinants since then. Outside of microcaps, the hedge returns to exploiting characteristics-based predictability have also been insignificantly different from zero since 2003.

Keywords: Firm characteristics; anomalies; cross-section; average U.S. monthly returns

JEL Classification: G1, M4
