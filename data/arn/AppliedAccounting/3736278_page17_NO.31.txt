Abstract

The creation of pro-forma financial statements presents a challenge for entrepreneurs without extensive training in finance and accounting. This paper is the third in a series that provides tools to assist managers with creating these estimates. The approach requires users to estimate only management variables. The template completes all other necessary calculations. This paper extends earlier work by introducing additional automation. Specifically, the template here automates tax and cost of capital calculations.

Keywords: Financial Statements, Pro-Forma Financial Statements, Forecasting, Entrepreneurship, Small Business Finance, Accounting for Small Businesses

JEL Classification: A2, G31, M13, M41
