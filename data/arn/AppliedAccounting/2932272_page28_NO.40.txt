Abstract

In this report, the authors propose a limited carryover tax basis regime that would be restricted to marketable securities owned at death. They argue that their proposal would promote equity and raise an estimated $10 billion in annual revenue without raising tax rates.

Keywords: Taxation, Tax Policy, Carryover Basis
