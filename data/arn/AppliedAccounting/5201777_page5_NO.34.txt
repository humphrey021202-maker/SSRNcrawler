Abstract

The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Big Data in financial risk assessment has revolutionized traditional risk modeling approaches by enhancing accuracy, efficiency, and predictive capabilities. AI-driven techniques, such as machine learning and natural language processing (NLP), enable financial institutions to analyze vast amounts of structured and unstructured data, improving the identification of emerging risks and anomalies. Meanwhile, Big Data technologies facilitate real-time risk monitoring, allowing financial organizations to make data-driven decisions and mitigate potential financial crises proactively. Additionally, AI-powered automation reduces human biases in risk evaluations, ensuring more objective and consistent assessments. The fusion of these technologies enhances credit risk analysis, fraud detection, and market risk forecasting, contributing to a more resilient financial ecosystem. However, challenges such as data privacy concerns, regulatory compliance, and model interpretability must be addressed to maximize the benefits of AI and Big Data in financial risk assessment. Future advancements in explainable AI and ethical AI frameworks are crucial for fostering trust and ensuring responsible AI deployment in the financial sector. 

Keywords: Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, Financial Risk Assessment, Machine Learning, Credit Risk, Fraud Detection, Market Risk, Regulatory Compliance, Explainable AI, Ethical AI
