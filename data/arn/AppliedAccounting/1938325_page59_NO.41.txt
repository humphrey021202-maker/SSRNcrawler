Abstract

This document describes the spreadsheets and the related textual narratives that we have developed for FSA and valuation. These spreadsheets and their related documents are available for free at http://www.godeohlson.com/. These spreadsheets can be used for two purposes: (1) teaching FSA and valuation using a spreadsheet-based approach, and (2) practical tools for implementing modern FSA and valuation concepts.

Keywords: Spreadsheets, Financial Statement Analysis, Valuation, Teaching, Implementation, Ohlson, Gode
