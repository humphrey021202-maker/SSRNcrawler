Abstract

This column discusses and summarizes the rules for interpreting and enforcing closing agreements between the Internal Revenue Service and Taxpayers. This column also discusses the decision in Davis v. United States, 811 F.3d 335 (9th Cir. 2016), in which the Court of Appeals allowed an assessment of tax to stand even though the IRS conceded it had breached its own closing agreement.
