Abstract

The Shelf Project is a collaboration of Tax Professionals to propose ways to raise U.S. federal revenue without a rate increase or a VAT. Shelf Projects improve the efficiency and fairness of the tax while raising revenue. The inventory breaks down the 66 Shelf Projects completed as of May 2012 by subject matter, including Tax Accounting, Basic Tax Issues, Business Entities, Employee Benefits, Environmental, Estate and Gift Taxes, Exempt Entities, Foreign issues, Financial Instruments and Institutions, Industry-specific Reforms, and Tax Procedures. The inventory has links to the proposals themselves.
