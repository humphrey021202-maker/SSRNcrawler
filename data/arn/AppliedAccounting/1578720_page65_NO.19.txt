Abstract

Many employees receive equity compensation as a supplement to their salaries. Traditionally, this compensation comes in the form of ESO grants. In recent years, accounting scandals (e.g., Enron, Tyco and WorldCom) created an environment that demanded more transparent and higher quality financial reporting. Subsequently ESO grants and accounting methods came under increased scrutiny by regulators. Accounting for Employee Stock Options (ESOs) has been one of the most controversial topics in financial reporting during the last decade. This article describes employee stock option mechanism and underlines the rationale for ESO grants. It also explains how ESOs differ from ordinary call options.

Keywords: Accounting, ESO, Stock Options
