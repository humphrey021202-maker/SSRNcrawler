Abstract

Since 2005, the courts have collectively issued more than 80 opinions involving challenges to deductions claimed under IRC § 170(h) with regard to conservation and facade easement donations. This outline provides a brief history of developments in the deduction context, discusses the practical implications of the recent court decisions, and offers advice on how to file a tax return package to minimize the risk of audit. It also briefly notes various other important issues, such as the IRS's focus on valuation and syndicated deals, quid pro quo, and reserved development rights.

Keywords: conservation easement, 170(h), 8283, qualified appraisal, qualified appraiser, restricted gift, merger, bankruptcy, extinguishment, swap, recordation, valuation, syndication

JEL Classification: L31, N50, Q15, Q24, R14
