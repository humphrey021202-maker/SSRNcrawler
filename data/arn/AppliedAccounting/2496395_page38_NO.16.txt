Abstract

The current controversy in corporate law concerns whether firms can discourage litigation by shifting its cost to shareholders. But corporate law courts have long engaged in fee-shifting — from shareholder plaintiffs to the corporation — under the “corporate benefit” doctrine. This Article examines fee-shifting in shareholder litigation, arguing that current practices are unsound from the perspective of both doctrine and public policy. Unfortunately, the fee-shifting bylaws recently enacted in response to the problem of excessive shareholder litigation fare no better. The Article therefore offers a different approach to fee shifting, articulating three specific reforms of the corporate benefit doctrine to quell the current crisis in shareholder litigation.

Keywords: corporate law, shareholder litigation, Delaware, attorneys' fees, corporate benefit, fee shifting, derivative suit, class action, mergers, acquisitions, corporate governance

JEL Classification: K22, K41
