Abstract

In this paper, we investigated the Japanese going concern problem and disclosure to consider the difference between the bankruptcy forecasting model and auditors' going concern judgment. We conducted an exploratory analysis by using data of companies listed in the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange in 2008 and 2010. Our findings can be summarized as follows. First, the auditors' judgment and bankruptcy forecasting model trended in the same direction, but with several gaps. The reason for the gap may be the failure of moral suasion, the existence of a "savior," an overestimate of risk, or an excessive reaction from auditors. Second, auditors became "risk evasive" after the amendment of the auditing standard in 2009, because of the amendment as well as the fact that the companies that finally went bankrupt without going concern disclosures had existed before revision Jan. 20, 2013.

Keywords: Going Concern Decision, Auditor, Bankruptcy Forecasting Model
