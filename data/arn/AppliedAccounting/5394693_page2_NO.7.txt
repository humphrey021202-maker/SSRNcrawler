Abstract

Interview performance is a critical factor in securing internships and entry-level positions for accounting graduates, yet many students lack structured preparation for this stage of recruitment. This study explores the perceived value of a multimodal preparation strategy among advanced accounting students and Beta Alpha Psi members, integrating video-based instruction with a live mock interview conducted by a local CPA firm. Surveys administered after each activity captured students’ perceptions of confidence, preparedness, and areas for improvement. Results suggest that combining digital instruction with experiential practice enhances interview readiness by improving self-efficacy and understanding of interview dynamics. These findings support prior research on experiential learning and extend it by highlighting student perceptions of hybrid preparation methods. Implications for accounting educators include embedding structured, practice-based interview preparation within curricula to better align student skills with evolving employer expectations.

Keywords: experiential learning, interview preparation, mock interviews, soft skills, career readiness, video-based instruction
