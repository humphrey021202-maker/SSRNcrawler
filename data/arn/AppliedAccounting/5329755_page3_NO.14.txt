Abstract

More than two decades after the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) reshaped the landscape of corporate financial reporting, Congress is rightly reassessing its long-term impact. Drawing on years of scholarship and engagement with SOX since its enactment, this testimony argues that while SOX effectively restored investor confidence and curbed earnings manipulation in the wake of major corporate scandals, its continued emphasis on internal control audits has produced diminishing returns.

The core insight is this: compliance is not the same as accuracy. A company may have strong internal controls yet misstate its financials—or have weak controls and report accurately. SOX treats controls as co-equal to financial statements, distorting audit priorities and fostering a sprawling compliance infrastructure more focused on auditability than effectiveness.

This testimony presents empirical evidence showing that financial restatements remain common—even among iconic firms like Archer Daniels Midland, CSX, and Macy’s—while internal control reports rarely serve as early warnings. Meanwhile, the costs are significant: averaging $1.5 million annually per firm, disproportionately burdening small companies and discouraging capital formation. The U.S. public company base has contracted sharply, with many firms citing SOX compliance as a factor in going private.

Investor views on control audits diverge—some see little value, others rely heavily on them—highlighting the need for regulatory flexibility. This testimony proposes targeted reforms to modernize SOX: prioritize financial statement reliability, reorient audit standards toward substance over form, and tailor compliance obligations to firm-specific risk.

The ISB's four-year duration (1997-2001) was cut short by disagreement between the SEC and the profession over the provision of non-audit services to public audit clients, a practice that SOX effectively abolished in 2002
