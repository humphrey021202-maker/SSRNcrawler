Abstract

In this article, Bogenschneider uses the history of the accumulated earnings tax (AET) and its underlying policy justifications as a backdrop for examining the IRS’s current enforcement practice, which effectively exempts U.S. multinationals from the AET. He concludes that the AET could be applied as a backup controlled foreign corporation rule, in lieu of subpart F, against any unreasonable corporate accumulations of earnings in foreign affiliates.

Keywords: 531, AET, accumulated earnings tax
