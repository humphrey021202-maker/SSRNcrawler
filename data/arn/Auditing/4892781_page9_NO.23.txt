Abstract

This study looks into how auditors' industry specialization affects the quality of audits in Pakistan's listed companies from 2018 to 2022.Total accruals and discretionary accruals are used as a measure of audit quality, and INDSP1, INDSP2, and INDSP3 are used as indicators of auditor industry specialization. Control variables include SIZE, AGE, GROWTH, LEVERAGE, and CFFO. The results show that INDSP3 has a significant impact on audit quality, but INDSP1 and INDSP2 do not. Additional robustness tests using discretionary accruals validate these results. These findings have consequences for auditors and policymakers, highlighting the value of industry specialization in enhancing audit quality in Pakistan's distinct economic environment. Acknowledging the importance of auditor specialization may ultimately improve market integrity and investor confidence.

Keywords: Audit Quality, Auditor Industry Specialization, Discretionary Accruals, Audit Partner, Audit Quality, Regression
