Abstract

The number of patents held by audit firms has increased more than sixfold over the past two decades. How do these innovations influence auditors, and through what mechanisms? Does it matter when an innovation is developed inside or outside of the local office (local vs. non-local innovations)? These are the questions we attempt to address. We find that future audit revenues increase following local office innovations but not after non-local innovations, suggesting that audit innovation does not generate uniform benefits across all offices within the same firm. Further analyses reveal three channels through which local innovations create economic benefits: (i) improved audit quality, (ii) higher audit efficiency, and (iii) negative spillover effects on competitors’ innovations. In addition, our identification tests help alleviate potential endogeneity concerns. Overall, our paper sheds light on the consequences of audit innovation, an area closely monitored by the PCAOB.

Keywords: Innovation, Patents, Audit Fees, Audit Quality, Audit Efficiency
