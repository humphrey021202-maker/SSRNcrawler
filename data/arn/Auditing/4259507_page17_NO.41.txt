Abstract

School districts in the United States are subject to the financial reporting and audit requirements of the Single Audit Act. This paper examines the impact of these requirements on school districts. Exploiting an increase in the regulatory threshold that exempts certain districts from single audits after 2015, I compare the districts that are newly exempted with those that have never been exempted and those that have always been exempted. I find that newly exempted districts tend to increase their spending but experience a decline in education performance. Additional analyses indicate that both financial reporting and audit requirements likely contribute to the results. Overall, the findings suggest that single audits enhance external monitoring and internal controls of school districts, thereby reducing waste of public resources.

Keywords: Regulation; Disclosure; Audits; School Districts; Education.

JEL Classification: H75, H83, I22, I28.
