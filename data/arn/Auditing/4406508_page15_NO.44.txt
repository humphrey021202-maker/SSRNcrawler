Abstract

We examine whether increased audit efficiency causes financial statement preparers to decrease their effort toward ensuring high-quality reporting outcomes, despite economic incentives to the contrary. Theory suggests this effect depends on preparers feeling comfortable reducing their effort. Our abstract experiment manipulates audit efficiency and whether auditors can directly observe preparers’ effort, and measures preparers’ tendency to experience pride in themselves as a proxy for their personal motivation to work hard. We find that efficient auditing leads to less effort, particularly unobservable effort, among less prideful preparers. We also find that preparers exert less effort overall when their effort is unobservable. Further, more efficient auditing does not lead to higher combined effort from preparers and auditors, nor do auditors in our setting necessarily increase their effort when they are more efficient. These results help explain how behavioral considerations may prevent improvements to auditing, such as increased efficiency, from improving reporting quality.

Keywords: audit efficiency, accountability, pride, financial reporting quality, experimental economics
