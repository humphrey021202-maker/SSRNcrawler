Abstract

Prior literature documents various differential audit outcomes associated with an auditor's level of industry specialization. However, archival studies have not prominently examined how industry specialist auditors utilize their client's industry-specific information to achieve these outcomes. Our study introduces a proxy for the client's industry-specific bankruptcy risk as one such piece of information relevant to the auditor's going concern assessment and reporting decision. Among audit firms that are annually inspected by the PCAOB, we find that the positive association between industry-specific bankruptcy risk and the auditor's propensity to issue a going concern opinion increases with the auditor's industry specialization. Furthermore, we find that industry-specialist auditors more properly weigh this industry-specific bankruptcy risk and achieve more accurate going concern reporting relative to non-specialist auditors. Our findings add to the bankruptcy, going concern, and industry specialist literature.
