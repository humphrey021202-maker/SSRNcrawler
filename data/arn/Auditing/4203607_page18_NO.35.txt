Abstract

We study the impact of a US cross-listing and the introduction of SOX on audit fees paid by UK firms. In doing so, we take forward existing research in two respects. First, we allow for unobservable heterogeneity in our analysis. Second, we capture the full impact of SOX on audit fees paid by cross-listed firms. Results from pooled, cross-sectional OLS regressions show that cross-listed firms pay higher audit fees. However, when we control for unobservable heterogeneity, the cross-listing premium disappears. The only persistent effect of cross-listing on audit fees is the significant increase for exchange-listed firms after SOX.

Keywords: Audit fees, foreign cross-listings, omitted variable bias, Sarbanes-Oxley Act, unobservable heterogeneity.

JEL Classification: G3, G18, M42, M49
