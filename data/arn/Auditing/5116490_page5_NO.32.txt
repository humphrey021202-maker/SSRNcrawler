Abstract

Prior research has tried to improve judgment and decision making in auditing by focusing on factors that cause an average error in a set of judgments, also called statistical bias. This study focuses on noise, the unwanted variability in professional judgment, which, like statistical bias, causes deviations from the ‘optimal’ judgment. We conduct a noise audit wherein auditors evaluate three different audit cases at two points in time. This approach allows us to measure the total amount of noise and decompose it into different types of noise. Our findings based on the judgments of 217 auditors, indicate significant noise in auditors' judgments. Level noise, stable pattern noise, and occasion noise equally contribute to the overall noise level. Further analysis reveals that noise is higher among auditors exhibiting more burnout symptoms. Our results can assist audit firms in reducing the unwanted variability in audit judgments and provide direction for future research in this area.

Keywords: noise, audit, judgment and decision making, professional skepticism
