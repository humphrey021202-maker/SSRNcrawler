Abstract

This study presents a transformative vision for ESG auditing by proposing a smart, technologyenabled model that leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Blockchain to enhance the credibility, transparency, and efficiency of non-financial assurance. As Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) reporting becomes a regulatory and reputational imperative worldwide, traditional manual assurance methods struggle to meet the demand for real-time validation and data integrity. This paper addresses that gap by introducing a five-layer conceptual framework for smart ESG auditing. The model begins with automated data acquisition through IoT sensors and enterprise systems, followed by blockchain-based data validation to guarantee immutability and traceability. It then employs AI-driven risk analysis and anomaly detection, maps ESG disclosures to global assurance standards such as GRI, SASB, IFRS S1/S2, and ISAE 3000, and concludes with realtime reporting dashboards for auditors and regulators. The study conducts a benchmarking analysis against current ESG reporting practices in Saudi Arabia and applies the model to three major listed companies-Saudi Aramco, SABIC, and Riyadh Bank-representing the environmental, social, and governance pillars, respectively. Findings show that while leading corporations are engaging in ESG disclosure, significant gaps remain in verification quality, standard alignment, and risk transparency. The proposed model bridges these gaps and offers a scalable pathway to real-time ESG assurance, marking a paradigm shift from conventional double-entry accounting to distributed ledger-enabled sustainability auditing.
