Abstract

This paper examines the effects of industry specialization (city-level, national-level, and joint-level) on audit pricing in Australia. Prior studies (e.g., Ferguson et al. 2003) have found that only joint specialist auditors (city- and national-level) enjoy audit fee premiums. However, the present study finds that industry specialists who are either city-level or national-level enjoy audit fee premiums. Moreover, joint specialist auditors charge relatively higher audit fees than either city-level industry specialists or national-level industry specialist auditors. There may be multiple reasons for these differences. For instance, Australia experienced a major move in its accounting reporting environment (i.e. mandatory adoption of IFRS in 2005), which may have increased the capacity of auditors at both city- and national levels. However, on further analysis, this study establishes that city-level industry specialist firms charge comparatively higher audit fees than national-level industry specialists, which is consistent with prior research.
