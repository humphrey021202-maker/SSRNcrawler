Abstract

English Abstract: Performance reasons in decision making based on business data usually requires a good management of multiple data formats and also processing speed, flexibility, portability, automation, power of suggestion and ease of use. The paper comes with theoretical ideas and practical examples in favor of using the Excel Data Mining Add-in’s for the aforementioned reasons. Most of the examples include figures linked to video scenarios constructed by the authors and part of an interactive on-line list with eighteen pieces. Together they contribute to understanding most of the requirements to fulfill in order to have valid examples and useful results.
