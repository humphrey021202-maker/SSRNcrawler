Abstract

Cybersecurity breaches are increasing in frequency and impose substantial costs on organizations, including disruptions to auditor-client relationships. While prior research has predominantly focused on the breached firms, this study examines whether a cybersecurity breach at one audit client influences auditor behavior toward other, non-breached clients. Drawing on the audit risk model and reputational contagion theory, we hypothesize and find that a breach at one client increases the likelihood of auditor resignations from non-breached peer clients. This effect is more pronounced among clients with high proprietary costs, auditors with higher technological expertise, and audit offices exposed to multiple or more salient breaches. Additionally, we document a decline on audit quality among non-breached clients following peer breaches. These findings provide novel evidence of the spillover effects of cybersecurity breaches in auditing and demonstrate how such events can reshape auditor-client dynamics, beyond the directly affected company.

Keywords: cybersecurity breaches, data breach risk, auditor resignation, audit quality, redacted disclosure, spillover effects, auditor-client relation
