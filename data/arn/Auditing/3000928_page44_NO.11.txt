Abstract

Nevertheless, methods of previous study conducted only with DART system’s existing corporate disclosure information have a limitation in study. Therefore, this study aims to identify change in audit fees and audit hours after the adoption of K-IFRS through questionnaire survey conducted on working-level auditors, and check whether or not such change properly reflects the changed environment of accounting audit market. In conclusion, audit fees resulting from open audit engagement system has changed to a structure in which appropriate time cannot be input due to low-priced competitive strategies. Improvement measures for this include assigned audit system expansion of regulatory authority, adoption of lower limit policy on audit fees, companies’ enhanced perception on audit, and auditors’ efforts to increase audit fees.

This study possesses a high value in introducing immediate responses of auditors (i.e. C.P.A.), accounting specialists, for the reasons of why audit fees increases, why audit fees decreases, and why audit fees does not change, not identifying what percentage increases for a result of empirical study
