Abstract

Between 2005 and 2019, Big4 auditors experienced fifteen data breaches. In this paper, we examine how client firms respond to an auditor-level data breach and whether auditors adjust their behavior in response. Using auditor-client pair observations, we find a higher likelihood of auditor turnover among clients of breach-affected auditors compared to those of non-breach auditors. When switching auditors, clients are more likely to choose an auditor who has not experienced a data breach in recent years (typically within the past 3-5 years). We also find that a data breach is negatively associated with audit quality -- breacha-ffected auditors become less conservative and allow greater discretion in financial reporting during the breach year. Furthermore, auditors increase audit fees following exposure to a data breach. Overall, our findings suggest that auditor-level cybersecurity breaches impair auditors' reputations and impose significant costs.

Keywords: cybersecurity breach, auditor reputation, auditor turnover, audit quality
