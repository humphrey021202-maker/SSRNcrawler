Abstract

Findings indicate that a Shumway method of decomposition of individual ratios is more explanatory of the existence of going concerns than a summary Altman Z score. Obfuscation of financial statement information appears to occur when going concern footnotes are reported.

Keywords: going concern, readability, disclosure, financial distress, Altman’s Z

JEL Classification: G10, M40, L50
