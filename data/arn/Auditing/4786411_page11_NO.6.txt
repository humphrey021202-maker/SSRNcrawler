Abstract

The PCAOB has faced shifting barriers to inspect Chinese audits from 2007 to 2022, reflecting the complex US-China relations. I examine variation in the likelihood of PCAOB inspection access, focusing on two critical events: a memorandum of understanding (MOU) in 2013 (increased the likelihood of access) and a break of cooperation (BOC) in 2017 (decreased such likelihood). Post-2013 MOU, smaller Chinese companies prefer Hong Kong listings over US listings, indicating challenges for marginal companies in absorbing heightened compliance costs. Post-2017 BOC, politically sensitive Chinese companies prefer Hong Kong listings over US listings, possibly to evade potential penalties imposed by the US authorities. Notably, US-listed Chinese companies did not experience detectable variation in audit quality, suggesting limited impact of cross-border inspection agreements without enforcement measures. Overall, changes in PCAOB oversight likelihood seem to have more immediate implications for the appeal of US market to Chinese companies than for their audit quality.

Keywords: PCAOB inspections, cross-border regulatory cooperation, cross-listings, audit quality, China, Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act.
