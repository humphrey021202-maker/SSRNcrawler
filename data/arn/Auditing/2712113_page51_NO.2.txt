Abstract

Purpose – International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) has been criticized for its potential for diverse interpretation. This study examines whether auditors make similar decisions (consensus) on ambiguous accounting transactions.

Design/methodology/approach – This paper conducts an experiment involving Korean auditors using two hypothetical transactions.

Findings – The results suggest that under IFRS, consensus of auditors’ decisions may not be reached when auditors favor aggressive reporting. However, when auditors make conservative reporting, consensus may be achieved. Auditor designation by the supervisory institution in Korea (Auditor Designation System, ADS) may also increase auditors’ consensus under IFRS.

Research limitations/implications – As this study uses only two hypothetical transactions, the findings may not be applicable to all types of transactions.

Practical implications – To increase audit quality under IFRS, increased focus on consensus of auditors’ decisions is needed. The use of ADS for certain problematic corporations in Korea may also increase audit quality.

Originality/value – In contrast to previous research, this study analyzes the consensus of auditors’ decisions to examine audit quality in the IFRS era. Consequently, this study provides new suggestions for the IFRS era from another perspective of audit quality.

Keywords: consensus, IFRS, audit quality, auditors' judgment and decision making (JDM)
