Abstract

This study investigates how Large Language Models (LLMs) make subjective judgments by comparing their evaluations with human assessments in audit failure scenarios. As AI integration in accounting and auditing accelerates, understanding LLM judgment, particularly in ethical dilemmas, is crucial. Using a juror decisionmaking task, I compared human responsibility judgments regarding audit failures with those from LLMs imbued with human "personas." The findings of the preregistered study reveal that LLMs assign less auditor responsibility and react more strongly to contextual cues, such as client AI-driven fraud, compared to humans, whose judgments appear more subtly influenced by psychological factors and social norms. Notably, both humans and LLMs identified the auditor's choice to use AI as a key basis for responsibility. This research contributes to AI "persona" studies, behavioral accounting by highlighting AI-human judgment divergence, and offers practical insights for AI policy and implementation in auditing.
