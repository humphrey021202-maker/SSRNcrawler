Abstract

This paper examines whether component auditor use changes following audit partner rotation. For U.S. multinationals, the audit partner must determine whether and to what extent audit procedures, and therefore component auditors, are needed in foreign locations. A new audit partner may not change component auditor use given audit firms strive for continuity during rotations, however, they may provide a fresh look at these decisions or face resource constraints and need time to acquire client and component auditor-specific knowledge. We find incoming partners significantly decrease the number of component auditors used. This decrease is not associated with audit quality changes and is magnified when the audit partner faces fee pressure, suggesting that resource constraints and the need to acquire knowledge explain the finding. While prior literature demonstrates increased hours following audit partner rotation, we provide insight into a specific, important, and complex decision made by new audit partners.

Keywords: Audit Partner Rotation; Component Auditor; Audit Quality; Audit Fees, component auditor, audit quality, audit fees
