Abstract

Theory suggests that information asymmetry between supplier and customer firms exacerbates the holdup problem, resulting in suboptimal relationship-specific investments. We hypothesize that an auditor common to a supplier and customer firm improves information flows, thereby alleviating the holdup problem. Consistent with this notion, we document greater financial statement similarity and higher levels of relationship-specific investments in supplier-customer relationships with common auditors. This positive relation manifests in product market settings most prone to holdup risk and in informationally opaque environments.  To address endogeneity concerns, we employ several identification strategies, including tests using placebo supplier-customer relationships, propensity score matching, and analyses exploiting exogenous shocks to auditor-client relationships. Collectively, these tests support a plausible causal interpretation. Overall, we demonstrate that common auditors mitigate investment inefficiencies in relationship-specific assets.

Keywords: Supplier-customer relationships, relationship-specific investments, common auditor, information asymmetry

JEL Classification: M4, L00, L14, L22
