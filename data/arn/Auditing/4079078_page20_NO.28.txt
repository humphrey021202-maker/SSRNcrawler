Abstract

This study investigates the role of auditor incentives in determining how auditors influence their clients’ unaudited non-GAAP earnings. I find that, despite the lack of a regulatory requirement, auditors do appear to play a monitoring role with respect to non-GAAP earnings in settings with higher potential risk. Specifically, I find evidence of higher non-GAAP earnings quality when auditors face greater reputation risk, regulatory risk, or client litigation risk. However, I also find evidence of a reduction in auditor monitoring when auditor independence may be impaired by economic bonding. I also document that auditor incentives are associated with the aggressiveness of non-GAAP earnings disclosures. My findings inform ongoing regulatory considerations regarding whether non-GAAP disclosures should be subject to greater auditor oversight, as well as the emerging literature that examines whether auditors play a role in their clients’ unaudited non-GAAP earnings.

Keywords: Non-GAAP earnings; PCAOB standards; audit quality; audit risk
