Abstract

This study explored the financial performance of non-financial firms listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX), focusing on four specific objectives: (1) to assess financial performance by evaluating key indicators such as revenue growth, profitability, and market capitalization; (2) to examine the impact of regulatory changes on operational practices, corporate governance, compliance, and access to financing; (3) to investigate how firms responded to economic instability, including the slowdown beginning in 2019 and the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic; and (4) to evaluate the extent of technological adoption and the barriers faced in integrating digital tools. The regression analysis revealed that the model including broader economic implications, innovation and technology, corporate social responsibility (CSR), and regulatory environment accounted for only 4% of the variance in financial performance, suggesting that many factors beyond the study's scope significantly influenced financial outcomes. Notably, no significant relationships were found between the independent variables and financial performance, indicating a need for further exploration into additional influences. The findings underscored the complex landscape influencing financial performance. While broader economic implications showed a potential positive trend, the lack of significant correlations with innovation, CSR, and regulatory factors highlights the necessity of examining a wider range of variables. The study concluded that future research should incorporate qualitative methods and explore additional quantitative factors such as customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. Recommendations included adopting a holistic approach to understanding financial performance, encouraging firms to leverage technological advancements, and aligning CSR initiatives with corporate strategies. By adopting a multi-dimensional perspective, firms can enhance their adaptability to emerging challenges, ultimately driving better financial performance in a dynamic economic environment.

Keywords: Financial Performance, Non-Financial Firms, Regulatory Impact, Technological Adoption, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)
