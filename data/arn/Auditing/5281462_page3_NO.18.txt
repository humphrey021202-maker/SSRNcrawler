Abstract

We examine the joint effect of two audit disclosures, materiality and critical audit matter (CAM) disclosures, on nonprofessional investor judgments and decisions. We find that audit materiality disclosures and CAM disclosures influence nonprofessional investor risk perceptions in different ways. While investors perceive heightened investment risk due to CAM disclosures, disclosing materiality information serves to reduce this effect. We also find that either of these disclosure types can enhance investor confidence that there are no material misstatements. Moreover, we demonstrate that these disclosures interactively affect nonprofessional investors' investment decisions only when CAM disclosures are not included. Specifically, when CAMs are not disclosed, nonprofessional investors are more likely to increase their investment when materiality disclosures are provided. Our results shed light on the effects of these expanded audit disclosures on nonprofessional investors' evaluation of financial statements.
