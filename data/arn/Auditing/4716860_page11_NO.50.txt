Abstract

This study investigates the use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), specifically GPT-4, in financial auditing. It builds on existing literature across various fields, where GenAIs have demonstrated efficacy in human judgment tasks. This study uses five experimental studies to explore GPT-4’s performance on auditing tasks. We compare GPT-4’s performance on these tasks with that of human auditors, highlighting its understanding and limitations. Our findings show that while GPT-4 can mirror the judgment of human auditors, it demonstrates distinct understanding on certain auditing contexts, indicating the need for model-specific training on auditing. Our research contributes to discussions on GenAI’s potential impact on auditing and the development of GenAI regulations in auditing. This study marks a founding effort in comparing human and GenAI auditing judgments, setting a framework for future research in the field.
