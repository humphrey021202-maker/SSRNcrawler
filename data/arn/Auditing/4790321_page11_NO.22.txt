Abstract

The transition to digital business systems has revolutionized organizational operations, driven by the integration of advanced technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI). This integration indicates a shift, redefining traditional practices and enhancing efficiency across diverse sectors such as finance, healthcare, and manufacturing. This study explores the impact of AI on auditing through a Systematic Literature Review to develop a Conceptual Framework for auditing practices. The theoretical implications show the transformative role of AI in redefining auditors' roles, shifting from retrospective examination to proactive real-time monitoring. Moreover, managerial contributions stress the benefits of AI integration, enabling informed decision-making in risk analysis, financial management, and regulatory compliance. Future research should explore AI's influence on auditing efficiency, performance, regulatory challenges, and auditor adaptation. Overall, this study underlines the importance for organizations to embrace AI integration in auditing practices, fostering innovation, competitiveness, and resilience

Keywords: Artificial Intelligence, Auditing, Conceptual Framework, Real-time Monitoring
