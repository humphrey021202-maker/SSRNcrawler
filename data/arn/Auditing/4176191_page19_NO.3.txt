Abstract

This study examines the impact of antidumping and countervailing investigations (ACIs) on the pricing of audit services. Using a unique dataset from China covering the period 2003– 2020, we find that audit fees for targeted firms significantly increase following antidumping and countervailing duty actions (ACDAs). This effect is more pronounced for firms with more opaque information environments and those with weaker bargaining power relative to their auditors. Path analysis suggests that heightened information risk is the primary driver of increased audit fees, supporting the risk premium argument. Finally, firms subject to these actions experience a decline in audit quality after ACDAs. Overall, our study highlights an important yet unexplored consequence of trade investigations on firms through the lens of auditors.

Keywords: Antidumping; Countervailing; Uncertainty; Audit pricing
