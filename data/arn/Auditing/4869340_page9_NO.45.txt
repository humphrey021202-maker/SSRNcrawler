Abstract

We exploit M&A events of other clients of an audit office as exogenous shocks that distract an audit office’s attention from the focal firm. We use these shocks to evaluate audit quality of audit offices, using various input- and output-based audit quality measures. We find that distracted audit offices receive lower audit fees and are more likely to lose clients. Firms with distracted audit offices are more likely to have financial misstatements and be targeted by shareholder class action lawsuits due to misstatement or misrepresentation of material information. Finally, the market reacts negatively to auditor distractions, suggesting that investors pay attention to auditor-related information.

Keywords: Mergers and acquisitions, Audit office, Audit Quality, Auditor Attention, Portfolio of Clients
