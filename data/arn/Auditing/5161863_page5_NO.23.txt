Abstract

This study explores the impact of audit quality on the financial performance of Nigerian firms, with a focus on Nestlé Nigeria Plc over the period 2014-2023. The research investigates how auditor independence, auditor size, and auditor remuneration influence the company's net profit margin. Nestlé Nigeria Plc was chosen due to its prominent position in the food and beverage industry and its extensive, publicly available financial records. A comprehensive analysis of pertinent literature was conducted, encompassing conceptual and theoretical frameworks, as well as empirical studies. The study employed an ex-post facto research design, analyzing secondary data from the company's annual reports. To test the hypotheses, advanced analytical techniques, including trend and SWOT analyses, were applied using E-Views software. The findings showed that auditor independence and auditor size did not significantly impact the company's financial performance, with p-values of 0.7833 and 0.1652, respectively. However, auditor remuneration demonstrated a significant effect, with a p-value of 0.0092, indicating its importance in shaping financial outcomes. Overall, audit quality, when considered as a collective factor, was found to significantly affect financial performance (p-value = 0.0069). The study recommends that food and beverage companies in Nigeria strengthen board independence to ensure higher audit quality. Furthermore, it calls for stricter audit oversight by regulatory bodies to enhance the reliability of financial reporting.
