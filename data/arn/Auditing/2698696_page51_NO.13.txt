Abstract

This research challenges the longstanding view that all auditor independence violations impair independence by considering Taylor et al.’s (2003) reliability framework, which proposes that service-related independence violations improve financial reporting reliability. This assertion is investigated by examining commercial lending officers’ perceptions of local and regional non-Big 4 CPA firms’ ability to improve financial reporting reliability when performing review, bookkeeping, and payroll services for the same nonpublic client. One-hundred and one participants who completed a between-subjects experiment indicate that auditor objectivity and the financial reporting reliability resulting from the independent review engagement are superior to a review engagement in which firms’ independence is violated by service-related impairments. Additional tests indicate that participants perceive regional non-Big 4 firms as being more objective and providing more reliable financial reporting than local non-Big 4 firms when performing an independent review engagement. However, this significant difference does not persist when local and regional CPA firms’ independence is violated by service-related impairments. These results have implications for research regarding the paradigm shift from independence to financial reporting reliability, and implications for future public policy which builds on accounting regulators’ recent attempt to allow service-related independence impairments.
