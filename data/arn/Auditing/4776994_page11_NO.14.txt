Abstract

We examine the adoption of the IAASB’s expanded audit report standards, specifically key audit matters (KAMs), in Hong Kong and Mainland China in 2016 and 2017, respectively. These jurisdictions together represent the largest emerging economy mandating expanded reports in a staggered manner. Our analyses do not find compelling evidence that KAMs offer incremental information to investors or enhance audit quality when employing a robust difference-in-differences design that overcomes limitations in related studies. Furthermore, cross-sectional tests examining variations in companies’ information environment and KAMs content do not lend support to incremental effects from these characteristics. Our findings align with theoretical predictions that stricter standards and disclosure of audit matters are unlikely to increase investor reliance on audit reports, or improve audit quality, in emerging economies with relatively weak investor protection and opaque information environment. We extend two streams of studies on international audit research and consequences of KAMs.
