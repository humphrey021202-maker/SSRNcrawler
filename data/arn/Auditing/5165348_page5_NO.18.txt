Abstract

This paper proposes the use of similarity-based inferences in audit investigations. Using the exception prioritization framework of risk-based selection, the paper demonstrates how similarity-based measures can be incorporated into the selection process with informative data. Similarity-based inferences extend the investigation outcome of examined selected exceptions to their sufficiently similar peers, allowing an auditor to make judgments not only about investigated exceptions but also about other similar exceptions. Examining multiple similar exceptions might be a suboptimal use of limited audit resources if an auditor can make an accurate inference about similar exceptions. We formalize exception prioritization as a discrete optimization problem and introduce similarity as an additional constraint. We propose and evaluate various approximation algorithms through multi-run simulations on a real-life dataset and discuss their implementations.

Keywords: audit analytics, audit selection, audit exceptions, exception prioritization, similarity, inference, risk score
