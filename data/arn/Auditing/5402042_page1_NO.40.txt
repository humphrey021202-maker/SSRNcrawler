Abstract

In today's rapidly evolving digital economy, the demand for secure, seamless, and scalable financial solutions is increasing significantly. Traditional payment systems primarily process single-recipient transactions, making bulk payments inefficient and error-prone. This study introduces MULTIPAYa MultiUser Payment Interface, a lightweight yet powerful system that allows users to send payments to multiple recipients in a single operation. Developed using Vite + React for rapid prototyping and Tailwind CSS for responsive design, the interface emphasizes usability, security, and scalability. Unlike existing solutions that require complex backend setups, MULTIPAY offers a frontend-first approach with integration-ready architecture for gateways such as Stripe and PayPal. Initial testing demonstrated improved transaction efficiency, reduced error rates, and positive user reception. With strong potential in freelance platforms, NGOs, startups, and enterprise applications, MULTIPAY bridges the gap between simplicity and functionality in digital financial systems.
