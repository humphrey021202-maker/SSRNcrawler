Abstract

Audit firms are increasingly emphasizing the societal impact of auditing in order to attract and retain talent, but the effects of such initiatives on audit quality remain unclear. This study examines how auditors' work significance beliefs—the belief that their work positively affects others—and the salience of those beliefs influence audit decisions. My survey evidence reveals that auditors value work significance; however, these beliefs are not always salient during audit tasks. My experimental evidence reveals that auditors with higher (lower) work significance beliefs perform more (fewer) audit-quality-enhancing behaviors. However, increasing the salience of work significance has unintended consequences: it reduces performance for auditors with lower significance beliefs while having no effect on those with higher beliefs. These findings highlight a critical trade-off—while increasing auditors’ work significance beliefs may improve audit quality, increasing work significance salience may backfire and reduce audit quality.

Keywords: Audit quality, Auditor judgment, Task significance, Work significance, Auditor motivation, work meaning, cognitive dissonance, auditor behavior
