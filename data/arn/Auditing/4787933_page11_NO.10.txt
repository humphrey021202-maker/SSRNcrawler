Abstract

We investigate how two common client behaviors, intimidation and information repetition, affect auditors’ evidence evaluation. Clients sometimes intimidate junior auditors and repeat prior information when explaining their positions during inquiry. Prior research shows intimidation may limit auditor follow up. We examine whether client intimidation can motivate auditors to think more skeptically about complex evidence and make higher quality judgments. However, we predict that information repetition reduces these effects when clients are more intimidating by increasing the perceived quality of client evidence. We find that auditors think more skeptically when clients are more intimidating and this improves auditors’ judgments and action decisions. However, client repetition unconsciously reduces the quality of these outcomes even when auditors try to be more skeptical. Our study provides a more complete understanding of how client behaviors affect audit quality and shows the importance of providing multiple routes to auditors for expressing skepticism when facing intimidating clients.

Keywords: Audit inquiry, intimidation, illusory truth effect, information repetition, skepticism, critical thinking
