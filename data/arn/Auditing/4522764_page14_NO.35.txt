Abstract

Key audit matters (KAM) are a primary communication channel between the auditor and financial statement users, so understanding the determinants of KAM disclosure is important. Our comprehensive cross-country study contributes to this goal by investigating the extent to which country-specific differences affect KAM reporting. We examine companies from 30~European countries, offering a well-suited research setting with uniform KAM regulation effective since 2017 and simultaneously broad institutional diversity. We find that a large set of economic, regulatory, audit market-related, and sociological country attributes significantly explains variation in KAM disclosure. We show that country-specific characteristics determine various aspects of KAM reporting—including the number, type, and writing style of KAMs—while we observe varying importance and associations regarding the different KAM disclosure measures. Our findings demonstrate the relevance of country attributes in the context of KAM reporting and provide a differentiated perspective on the implementation of the expanded audit report regulation across Europe.
