Abstract

This paper presents PriviLynis, a security auditing framework designed to detect and mitigate privilege escalation vulnerabilities in Linux systems. Leveraging the Lynis tool, PriviLynis introduces tailored scripts and SELinux policies to target specific vulnerabilities such as Looney Tunables (CVE-20234911), StackRot (CVE-2023-3269), and Dirty Pipe (CVE-2022-0847). The framework was implemented and tested across different Linux distributions, including Kali Linux and Ubuntu, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing vulnerability detection with minimal false positives and resource impact. Altogether the conclusions established PriviLynis as a robust and adaptable solution for counteraction of privilege escalation risk and raise the levels of protection in Linux platforms.

Keywords: PriviLynis, security auditing, Privilege Escalation, Linux Vulnerabilities, SELinux Integration, CVE Detection, Lynis
