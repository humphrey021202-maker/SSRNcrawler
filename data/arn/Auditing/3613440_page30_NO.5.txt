Abstract

As remote auditing becomes a common work arrangement, the profession is concerned that decreased auditor-client interactions and remote supervision challenges diminish audit quality. In response, firms have instituted steps such as increased supervisor monitoring. We investigate how two remote audit factors, spatial distance between auditors and clients and frequency of supervisor status update requests, influence judgments. We theorize psychological distance from working remotely facilitates higher-level thinking, enhancing creative hypothesis generation that helps uncover financial statement errors. More frequent supervisor monitoring causes auditors to feel constrained, reducing effort and creativity, diminishing the benefits of working remotely. In an experiment, relative to working at the client site, auditors working remotely consider a wider range of potential causes for a seeded error, and exhibit higher decision quality, when monitored less frequently than more frequently. Thus, working remotely can enhance audit quality on creative problem-solving tasks, conditional on the nature of the supervisor’s monitoring.



Keywords: remote auditing, monitoring frequency, analytical procedures, spatial distance, psychological distance, management control systems
