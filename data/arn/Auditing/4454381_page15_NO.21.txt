Abstract

COVID-19 unexpectedly created many remote working options for lower-level auditors. However, firm leaders still often believe in-person interactions are better for development. Thus, this study explores the determinants of lower-level auditors’ inclination to work remotely vs. in-person. A firm provided access to data surveying its employees’ perceptions of how COVID-19 work modifications affected their teams and firm, as well as their future remote working preferences. Drawing on recent developments in team theory, we contend that the more auditors’ value their work environment, the more they value in-person interactions. Our results suggest that firm leaders must first improve team interactions—namely, team effectiveness, productivity, and communication—while also improving overall perception of the firm culture to increase auditors’ perceived value of in-person interactions. Reassuringly, any remote working inclinations are seemingly constrained by auditors’ due care expectations. Our study contributes to understanding auditors’ remote working decisions and, likely, turnover intentions more broadly.

Keywords: audit, career development, culture, flexible work, team interaction, virtual team
