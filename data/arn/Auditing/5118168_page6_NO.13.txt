Abstract

This study examines the correlation between ESG behavior and audit pricing in China, offering a novel perspective by incorporating ownership structure. The findings reveal the higher the corporate ESG performance, the lower the audit pricing. Further analysis shows ownership structure moderates the relationship between ESG behavior and audit pricing. We also found the reverse effect of ESG behavior on audit pricing is achieved by reducing corporate risk. These results have important implications for auditors considering ESG performance in conjunction with its equity structure before making audit decisions. This study provides scientific basis for the economic consequences of non-financial performance evaluation of firms.

Keywords: ESG behavior, audit pricing, ownership structure, corporate risk
