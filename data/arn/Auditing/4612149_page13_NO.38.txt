Abstract

Audit regulators suggest that auditors who develop their own independent estimates are less influenced by management’s preferences. To test this notion, we augment order effects theory, introducing the concept of “sourced” and “developed” information cues and theorizing how different orderings of those cues alter auditors’ judgments. We predict and find that, contrary to popular belief, auditors are more susceptible to management’s biasing influence when they develop an independent estimate before (vs. after) receiving management’s persuasion attempt. We contribute to the audit literature by examining when auditors’ independent expectations more effectively mitigate management’s biasing influences. We also broaden order effects theory, examining how a developed cue’s placement can trigger either primacy or recency effects to manifest during a task, predictably altering decision makers’ intermediate and final judgments.

Keywords: Accounting Estimates, Independent Estimates, Management Preferences, Persuasion Attempts, Audit Quality, Sourced Information Cue, Developed Information Cue
