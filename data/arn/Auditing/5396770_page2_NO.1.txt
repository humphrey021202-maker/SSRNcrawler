Abstract

As cross-chain protocols mature, asset transfers across blockchains have become increasingly common, creating new auditing challenges. Cross-chain transfers involve multiple single-chain transactions distributed across different blockchains, and collecting such multi-chain data is cumbersome, making traditional query-based audits highly inefficient. Moreover, revealing full transaction details during audits introduces serious privacy risks.  This paper proposes privXCA, an efficient and privacy-preserving auditing architecture for cross-chain transfers. Built upon the prevalent burn-to-mint cross-chain model, privXCA introduces a multistage audit proof mechanism for cross-chain transfers based on zero-knowledge proofs. Firstly, we design a batch audit proof for single-chain transactions that enables compliance verification without revealing sensitive details. Secondly, we design a batch audit proof for cross-chain transfers, which associates burn and mint single-chain transactions scattered across source and destination blockchains under encryption and outputs a concise proof. Thirdly, to support efficient time-range auditing, we design a recursive audit proof and construct a time-ordered audit state linked list, stored on a Layer-2 audit blockchain.  Experimental results show that privXCA audits all cross-chain transfers within any time range in a constant time of about 3 seconds. For 10,000 transfers, it is nearly 800× faster than traditional query-based methods, demonstrating the practicality of privXCA.

Keywords: Blockchain, Cross-chain Transfer, PrivacyPreserving, Auditing, Zero-Knowledge Proof
