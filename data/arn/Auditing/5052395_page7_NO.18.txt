Abstract

Auditors have been subjected to an increasingly extensive regulatory framework and more tasks. This escalating regulatory "overload" leaves little room for critical reflection, fostering a conformist mindset among auditors. Auditing is fundamentally a philosophical field rooted in logic. Therefore, education must provide students with insights into the cognitive processes behind auditors' professional judgment and skepticism, enabling them to detect material misstatements in reporting, including those due to economic crime. Emphasizing sociocultural learning in the classroom and developing so-called academic DNA through work on the master's thesis will shape them into auditors with social competence and a creative mindset, allowing them to contribute to the development and improvement of audit practices. This way, auditing can also be promoted as an exciting profession for socially adept, creatively thinking young people.

Keywords: auditing, education, IAASB, the Financial Supervisory Authority, regulation, cognition theory, critical thinking, creative thinking, social competence, academic DNA, bureaucratization
