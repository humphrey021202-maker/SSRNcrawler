Abstract

This study experimentally examines potential non-professional investors’ understanding of a random sample of SOX 404 reports containing both IT weaknesses (ITWs) and non-IT weaknesses (non-ITWs) as reflected in their internal control weakness (ICW) severity ratings and their accuracy in identifying the reported ICWs. We find that the number of perceived non-ITWs and report length are positively associated with potential investors’ ICW severity ratings and that failing to perceive non-ITWs reduces potential investors’ ratings of weakness severity. However, the number of perceived ITWs is not associated with potential non-professional investors’ ratings of the overall severity of ICWs. Potential investors’ errors in identifying both non-ITWs and ITWs are associated with the number of non-ITWs and ITWs reported. Also, errors are positively associated with lower readability of SOX 404 reports. We identify specific types of ITWs and non-ITWs that contribute the most to the total number of errors made by non-professional investors in perceiving ICWs.

Keywords: Informativeness of SOX 404 reports; information technology control weaknesses; internal control weaknesses; content analysis; novice auditors; experienced auditors
