Abstract

This paper proposes a framework for audit standard-setting that would transform today's slow, linear rule-making with iterative, stakeholder-centric development cycles. After documenting multi-year lags in recent projects across leading audit standard setters and diagnosing weaknesses-reactiveness, rigidity, and episodic consultation-we apply principles from the software industry's agile development processes to regulatory design. We recommend breaking large standard-setting projects into modular "sprints," forming cross-functional teams, using pilot sandboxes, and embedding continuous investor, auditor, and public feedback. We discuss how governance safeguards such as quality checkpoints, transparent documentation, balanced advisory panels, and post-implementation reviews can address risks of rushed or captured rule-making. By treating standards as living products rather than episodic pronouncements, audit regulators can better protect investors amid rapid technological and market change.

Keywords: PCAOB, Standard Setting, Agile
