Abstract

This study aims at highlighting the severe impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the audit and assurance processes and procedures. In doing so, desk research is employed to collect data for this study. The researcher drew upon document analysis, literature review, and websites analysis to understand the possible impacts of the pandemic on auditor work. We observed that the COVID-19 had significant implications for the whole audit process, including the emergence of new fraud risks and posing changes in risk assessment and accounting estimates and the required revisions of the previous set audit plans. This has affected both the treatment of subsequent events and the type of opinion issued by the auditor. This study directs auditors' attention and standard setters to the required changes and revisions in the audit process and procedures. This is beneficial in the present exceptional situation for the audit process to match the changes needed in the business society brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Keywords: Audit, Accounting, COVID-19, Fraud, Risk Assessment
