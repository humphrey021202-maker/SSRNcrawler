Abstract

The essay explores the application of RAG-enhanced AI agents in auditing tabular data processing as an assistant. The essay first identifies the current problem and the essay motivation as foundation models of LLMs and non-RAG-enhanced AI agents face critical limitations in handling structured tabular data and maintaining task-specific context, especially in auditing procedures that require complex reasoning and multi-document analysis. Then, the essay introduces detailed steps to develop RAG-enhanced AI agents. The designed AI agents offer a process for tabular data assistants in auditing and planning-related tasks. A baseline RAG agent and a graph RAG AI agent were designed as a demonstration, connecting a private knowledge base of 160 auditing procedure files from an IPO-focused auditing firm. In the evaluation phase, the experimental results show that non-RAG-enhanced models achieve less than 40% accuracy for complex tasks. RAG-enhanced AI agents maintain significantly higher accuracy rates above 80%. The findings prove the AI agent's potential to offer cost-effective, accurate, and efficient solutions for auditing AI agent customization, which could benefit small to medium-sized auditing firms that have relatively limited resources for developing AI.
