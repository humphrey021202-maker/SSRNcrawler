Abstract

Whether audit firms should disclose financial statements is controversial among investors, practitioners, and regulators. The debate centers on whether audit firms’ financial statements provide information about audit quality. Based on hand-collected data from U.K. audit firms’ financial statements, we construct four measures that capture audit firms’ resource investments (i.e., human capital, workplace environment, advanced technologies) and risk exposures (i.e., litigation costs). We find that audit firms with higher staff costs, more valuable tangible assets, more valuable IT software, and lower litigation provision generally provide higher-quality audits, as reflected by smaller absolute accruals and fewer going concern reporting errors. Additional tests show that the information in audit firms’ financial statements appears unique and is not contained in other public disclosures. Last, we find that audit firms with higher staff costs, more valuable workplace properties, and lower litigation provision are also associated with shorter report lags, a proxy for higher audit efficiency.

Keywords: audit firms, audit quality, financial statements, human capital, workplace environment, technologies, litigation provision
