Abstract

Auditors often view themselves as enhancers of financial statements with an aim to provide an objective view about the truth and fairness of reported financial information. This paper seeks to critically examine the claim that the audit profession has failed in the 21st century and analyses the reasons for such failure. It also attempts to shed some light upon the various benefits this noble profession brings to society, more specifically to the corporate world.

Keywords: Audit, failures, scandals, benefits, importance
