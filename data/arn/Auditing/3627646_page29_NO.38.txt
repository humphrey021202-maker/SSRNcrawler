Abstract

Prior research has documented an outcome effect such that appropriately skeptical auditors
receive higher performance evaluations when they identify a misstatement than when they do
not. In Experiment 1, we find differences in performance evaluations (as identified in prior
research and that we empirically confirm) are driven by a positive reaction to auditors who
identify a misstatement rather than a negative reaction to auditors who do not. In Experiment 2,
we use the evaluation fact pattern from Experiment 1 and find outcome effects do not
differentially impact auditors’ subsequent professional skepticism, so long as the auditor is aware
of their initial task performance evaluation. Taken together, results from our experiments
contradict the consensus inference in prior research that the audit evaluation system inadvertently
disincentivizes profession skepticism. Rather, our results suggest the evaluation system not only
does not deter professional skepticism, but also is critical in facilitating auditors’ professional
skepticism.

Keywords: professional skepticism, outcome effects, auditor review process

JEL Classification: M42, M41
