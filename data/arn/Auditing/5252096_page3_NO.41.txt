Abstract

Auditors often fail to revise audit plans in response to emerging risks during fieldwork-a concern raised in prior research and PCAOB inspection reports. This study examines whether performance measures based on budget adherence contribute to this rigidity by reinforcing surrogation, a cognitive bias in which auditors unconsciously substitute budget compliance for broader audit objectives. I also test whether a structured intervention-Constraint-Based Planning (CBP)-can reduce surrogation and improve resource allocation in a dynamic audit environment. Using a novel experiment that adapts the logic game Minesweeper to simulate evolving audit risk and budget constraints, I find auditors evaluated on budget adherence are less likely to reallocate effort in response to shifting risks, leading to systematic misallocation. In contrast, those who complete CBP exercises respond more strategically to risk changes, prioritizing high-risk accounts without exceeding budget constraints. These results extend prior surrogation research by demonstrating that structured, multi-phase planning interventions can promote adaptive, risk-sensitive decision-making in environments where performance goals are ambiguous and evolving.
