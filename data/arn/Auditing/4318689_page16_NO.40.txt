Abstract

Professionals across domains are increasingly using interactive technologies, such as chatbots, as decision aids. A critical gap exists in understanding their real-time impact on decision-makers' judgment during complex tasks, especially when the professional is susceptible to judgment biases. This research addresses this gap by investigating whether and how a domain-specific decision support system with an interactive structured dialogue feature can mitigate judgment biases. Based on Dual-Process Theory, results from two experiments demonstrate how interaction with the DSS aids professionals in overcoming the dilution effect and the acceptability heuristic, which are two significant barriers to sound judgment in complex scenarios. Through a verbal protocol analysis examining the professionals' real-time reasoning while interacting with the DSS, we observe a shift toward systematic information processing as they assimilate more important cues into their final decisions. This study provides practical and theoretical contributions, demonstrating how interactive technology can enhance judgment quality, leading to effective and reliable outcomes in complex tasks.

Keywords: auditor judgment bias, verbal protocol analysis, fraud risk, decision support system, systematic information processing
