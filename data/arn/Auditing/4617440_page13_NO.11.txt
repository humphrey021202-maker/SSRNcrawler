Abstract

This study examines whether competitive pressure from peers within a local office (i.e., internal competition) affects audit partners’ audit pricing decisions. Using U.S. audit partner data from 2016 to 2022, we find that audit partners respond to internal competition by charging their clients lower audit fees. The effect is more pronounced for initial audit engagements, in more competitive local audit markets, and when peers share similar personal attributes, such as gender and experience. However, the effect is weaker for industry specialist audit partners. We also find evidence that internal competition is negatively associated with audit quality for non-Big 4 clients. Overall, this study provides initial evidence of the effect of internal competition among audit partners on audit outcomes.

Keywords: audit partner, audit pricing, audit quality, internal competition, competitive pressure, social comparison
