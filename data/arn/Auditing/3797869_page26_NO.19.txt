Abstract

This study investigates the joint influence of auditors’ behavior during GAAP reporting discussions and the audit committee’s emphasis on questioning non-GAAP measures on managers’ non-GAAP disclosures in earnings press releases. While external auditors’ cooperativeness or contentiousness when discussing subjective GAAP disclosures influences management’s GAAP reporting, psychology research suggests auditors’ inhibitory behavior can carry over to impact subsequent non-GAAP reporting. Additionally, recent calls for audit committees to extend beyond GAAP and question non-GAAP disclosures may impact non-GAAP reporting by providing direct, institutional pressure. We experimentally examine if contentious or cooperative auditor behavior and the audit committee’s questioning focus influence managers’ non-GAAP disclosure choices when there are incentives for aggressive reporting. Senior executives are more likely to make loss exclusions from non-GAAP earnings and present favorable non-GAAP earnings more prominently in an earnings release when auditors are cooperative during GAAP discussions, but only when the audit committee questions exclusively GAAP, and not non-GAAP, disclosures. Alternatively, audit committee questioning focused on both GAAP and non-GAAP disclosures subdues more opportunistic non-GAAP reporting by increasing managers’ thoughtful consideration of disclosure factors when the auditor is cooperative. However, with a contentious auditor, the audit committee’s questioning focus does not alter managers’ disclosure choices because increased inhibition from the auditor’s contentious behavior by itself leads to more thoughtful disclosure consideration. While both auditors and audit committees individually constrain non-GAAP disclosures, jointly they do not add additional constraint. These findings provide insights into how the mutual influence of governance mechanisms can curb aggressive non-GAAP reporting and can aid regulators' efforts at improving non-GAAP reporting quality.
