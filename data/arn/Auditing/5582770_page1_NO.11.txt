Abstract

We investigate whether timely auditor reviews improve the quality of interim financial reporting. First, we provide descriptive evidence that interim reviews result in more conservative financial reporting, based on actual accounting adjustments. Second, we exploit a quasi-natural experiment arising from an SEC mandate that required interim reviews for all public companies. Before the rule, Big 5 auditors typically conducted such reviews voluntarily, while non-Big 5 auditors generally did not. This setting enables a difference-indifferences design, with clients of non-Big 5 auditors serving as the treated group. Our evidence suggests the quality of interim financial reporting significantly improved after the introduction of mandatory interim reviews. Additional analysis shows that the effects persist in the post-Sarbanes-Oxley period. Overall, our study provides the first comprehensive U.S.-based evidence that auditor reviews enhance the quality of interim financial reporting. Data availability: Data are available from the public sources cited in the text.

Keywords: Audit, Quarterly Review, Reporting Quality, Adjustments
