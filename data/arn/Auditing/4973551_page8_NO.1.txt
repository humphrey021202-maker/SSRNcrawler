Abstract

We investigate whether audit partners exhibit greater leniency towards audit clients located in their childhood or pre-professional home state. While prior research has examined the audit quality effects of geographic distance between an auditor and client as well as auditors’ social ties to company management or directors, this study uniquely examines auditors’ psychological affinity to places rather than people. Using hand-collected data on audit partners, company managers, and directors, we find evidence of partners exhibiting hometown bias in the form of greater leniency towards clients’ opportunistic reporting. However, we find no evidence to suggest that these psychological biases affect audit reporting judgments requiring national office consultation, highlighting the importance of quality controls in mitigating individual auditor biases. Further, we find a client preference toward audit partners with hometown ties, underscoring the importance of these findings for audit firms, audit committees, and regulators. 

Keywords: home bias, place attachment, place identity, audit partners, auditor leniency
