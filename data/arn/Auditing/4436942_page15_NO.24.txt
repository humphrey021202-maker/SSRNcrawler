Abstract

Auditing in Kazakhstan lacks scientific researches. We’ve approached the modern audit’s condition by reestablishing the history of development of Kazakhstani audit since inception until today. Based on international experience, we formed hypotheses in league with practical needs of today’s profession. We conducted survey among Kazakhstani auditors and analyzed the results obtained. We concluded that quality of audit is directly dependent on (1) high level of idealism (low level of pragmatism) and (2) low level of relativism of personal qualities, (3) high level of organizational ethics, (4) low level of informal culture (clanism), (5) high level of adherence to profession.

Secondarily, we noted that (6) ACCA holders’ responses possess more clear-cut negative correlation between relativism/clanism and audit quality than the average respondents’; (7) males’ responses possess more clear-cut negative correlation between relativism/clanism and audit quality than females’; (8) more experienced auditors’ responses possess more clear-cut negative correlation between relativism/clanism and audit quality than the less experienced auditors’. Thus, current research effectively outlines guidelines for Kazakhstani auditors to maximize their professional effectiveness.

Keywords: Kazakhstan, audit, history, ethics, clanism, relativism, idealism, ACCA
