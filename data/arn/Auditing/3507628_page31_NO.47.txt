Abstract

Although higher investor sentiment has been linked with opportunistic managerial behavior in the face of more optimistic investors and analysts, its impact on external auditors’ risk assessment has yet to be examined. As such, we examine how firms’ external auditors react to investor sentiment. We document that although the likelihood of misstatements is higher when sentiment is high, suggesting elevated audit risk, auditors charge lower audit fees and report going concern opinions (GCO) less conservatively during such periods. This reduction in reporting conservatism is unwarranted; results reveal that auditors are less likely to issue GCOs to clients which subsequently file for bankruptcy (Type II error) during high sentiment periods. We conjecture and find that auditors’ response to high sentiment is best explained by a reduction in auditors’ litigation risk. Specifically, we document that auditors are less likely to be sued and the market reacts less negatively to misstatement announcements when sentiment is high. Collectively, our findings suggest that, although misstatement risk is increasing with sentiment, auditors’ legal risk actually declines, prompting a conflict between auditors’ professional and commercial incentives.

Keywords: Audit fees, Misstatements, Investor sentiment, Going concern opinions
