Abstract

In this paper, we examine firms that repeatedly change their external auditors. We first document that over the period from 2006 to 2022, 38 percent of auditor changes occur less than five years from the previous auditor change, signaling repeat auditor changes. We then examine why firms repeatedly change their auditor. Compared to firms with single auditor changes—that is, firms who changed auditors after five years or for the first time, repeat auditor changers have stronger economic motivations, exhibit characteristics suggesting dissatisfaction with their auditor, and have a higher risk profile. Next, we examine the consequences of repeatedly changing auditors. We find that repeat changers tend to realize audit fee savings, but these savings come at a cost, as repeat changes are associated with a higher likelihood of unfavorable audit opinions. More importantly, repeat auditor changes are linked to a significantly higher likelihood of future bankruptcy. These findings highlight important differences between single and repeat auditor changes and suggest that firm stakeholders may benefit from additional disclosures about auditor changes beyond those currently required.

Keywords: auditor changes, dismissal, resignation, audit fees, bankruptcy, auditor opinions
