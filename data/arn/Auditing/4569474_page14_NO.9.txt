Abstract

The IAASB and the PCAOB issued new and somewhat differing expanded auditor reporting standards that resulted in Key Audit Matter (KAM) and Critical Audit Matter (CAM) disclosures, both of which regulators intended to enhance transparency around judgmental matters in the audit. We reveal differences in KAMs and CAMs, employing a research design whereby we compare audit reports of cross-listed companies for which the same auditor provides both disclosures for the same company in the same period. We find that KAMs are greater in number than CAMs, and while both usually address similar core topics, KAMs cover a wider array. KAM disclosures also tend to be longer, convey a greater sense of uncertainty, and describe more audit procedures that the engagement team used to address the matter(s). Multi-variate analyses reveal that these differential features of KAMs provide more value-relevant information compared to CAMs as reflected in investors' equity valuations and ability to predict future earnings.

Keywords: auditor reporting, critical audit matters (CAMs), disclosure, earnings persistence, key audit matters (KAMs), value relevance

JEL Classification: M41, M42, M48
