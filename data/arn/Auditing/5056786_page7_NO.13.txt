Abstract

The Responsible Artificial Intelligence (AI) Framework proposed in this report provides a foundation for addressing the risks and opportunities of AI in accountancy. By focusing on professional accountability, data integrity, transparency and inclusivity, the framework offers a practical approach to managing AI’s influence in the profession. As AI technology continues to evolve, ongoing stakeholder engagement and a dynamic framework will ensure that AI serves the interests of both the profession and society at large, fostering trust and innovation in accounting.
