Abstract

We investigated the relationship of self-regulation and the audit quality. We conduct our experiment in the context of auditing in a public goods game. First, players decide whether to join a self-regulatory organization, and second, whether to punish non-contributors. Finally, players assess the audit quality. The results indicate that the actions of joining self-regulatory organizations, and executing the punishment were effective with each passing period. Implementing these actions resulted in higher audit quality. We conclude that it is not enough for the auditor to merely belong to a self-regulatory organization; it is also important to undertake spontaneous self-purification actions. The findings of this study indicate the importance of encouraging self-regulation in the auditing field, particularly in the context of the recent tendency to strengthen government regulations.

Keywords: self-regulation; audit quality; punishment

JEL Classification: M42, C92
