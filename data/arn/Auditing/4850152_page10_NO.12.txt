Abstract

This study investigates the determinants of auditor remuneration in the Brazilian basic infrastructure sector, utilizing a comprehensive panel dataset of 31 companies listed on B3 from 2011 to 2022. Employing a fixed-effect model, we examine the influence of various factors on audit fees, including the choice of Big Four audit firms, company size, corporate governance mechanisms, and financial characteristics. Our findings reveal that engaging Big Four auditors and the size of a company's total assets are positively associated with higher audit fees. Additionally, we find that robust corporate governance practices contribute to increased audit fees, likely due to the demand for more rigorous audits. Contrary to expectations, the time elapsed between the fiscal year-end and the announcement of financial results is negatively correlated with audit fees, suggesting potential efficiencies in extended audit processes. Interestingly, financial restatements are associated with reduced audit fees, possibly indicating that prior error corrections lead to less complex subsequent audits. These insights offer valuable guidance for companies in the basic infrastructure sector regarding auditor selection, corporate governance practices, and financial reporting strategies. Furthermore, our research contributes to the broader understanding of audit fee determinants in an emerging market context, providing a foundation for future investigations into the relationship between auditor remuneration, audit quality, and corporate financial performance.
