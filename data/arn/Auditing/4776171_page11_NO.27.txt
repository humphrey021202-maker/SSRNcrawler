Abstract

According to the 2014 amendment of the Parent-Subsidiary Directive (2014/86), Member States are obliged to tax distributed profits at the level of the parent company "to the extent that such profits are deductible by the subsidiary". This article analyses whether this tax obligation conflicts with the tax treaties of Member States.
