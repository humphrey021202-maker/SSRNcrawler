Abstract

In 2019, the audit firm PwC was sanctioned by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for violating auditor independence rules for providing prohibited non-audit services (NAS) to audit clients. We use this setting to examine whether violation of auditor independence rules is associated with a reduction in perceived or actual audit quality. The sanctions against PwC provide a rare opportunity to explore whether lack of auditor independence reduces investors’ confidence in the audited financial statements. We find that PwC independence rule violations are associated with a reduction in perceived audit quality and the reduction is concentrated in clients with high abnormal audit fees and weak audit committees, suggesting investors are reacting to PwC independence violations and not just firm-wide reputation concerns. We also find actual audit quality improves from the violation period to the post-violation period. Overall, we provide evidence that independence rule violations impair audit quality, and that rules in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 prohibiting certain NAS are valued by investors.

Keywords: PCAOB, auditor independence, non-audit fees
