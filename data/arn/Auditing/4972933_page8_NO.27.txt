Abstract

This study examines the effects of secrecy, as proposed by Gray (1988), on the relationship between auditor industry specialization and audit fee premiums. Using a sample of foreign firms listed on the U.S. Stock Exchanges for years 2005-2011, we find that auditor industry specialization premiums vary based on the secrecy dimension as formulated by Gray (1988). While industry specialist auditors obtain higher audit fees than non-specialists, these premiums are mitigated in societies that are less transparent (more secretive). However, these differential audit fee premia are observed only in developing countries. This finding suggests that specialization effects vary systematically across cultures and that developing economies are susceptible to the effects of societal values. These observations shed light on the varying levels of demand for specialization across countries, potentially leading to variations in industry specialists' audit pricing strategies.

Keywords: auditor industry specialization, culture, audit fees, international accounting
