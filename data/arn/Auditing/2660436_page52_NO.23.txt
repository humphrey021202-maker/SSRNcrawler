Abstract

A vignette study of 567 client acceptance decisions by 67 Dutch auditors showed that the prospect of acquiring additional assignments significantly increases the likelihood that auditing partners accept an audit assignment from a new client, thereby violating a rule of the auditing profession. Audit ﬁrm strategy was found to moderate the effect of the acquisition of additional assignments: partners working in audit ﬁrms emphasizing a professional orientation are less likely to accept such risky assignments, whereas a commercial orientation of audit ﬁrms was found to exacerbate the effect of acquiring additional services. Contrary to expectations, punishment severity for professional mistakes increases the likelihood of client acceptance.

Keywords: Professional ethics, auditing, norm violations
