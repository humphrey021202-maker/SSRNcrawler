Abstract

Auditors play a crucial role in evaluating a company's going concern status by issuing opinions and, more recently, disclosing Critical Audit Matters (CAMs) that highlight areas involving high levels of uncertainty and significant auditor judgment. A key aspect of auditors' going concern evaluations is their assessment of management's mitigation plans. This research examines how going concern CAMs provide useful information by allowing auditors to highlight "close call" judgments where they are hovering around the threshold of substantial doubt. I predict and find that going concern CAMs provide useful information regarding the future success of management's mitigation plans - specifically as it relates to a company's likelihood to file for bankruptcy or delist from their stock exchange as well as changes in a company's future profitability, liquidity, and solvency. Overall, these findings suggest that going concern CAMs offer financial statement users valuable insight into auditors' uncertainties surrounding a company's viability.

Keywords: Audit Opinions, Critical Audit Matters (CAMs), Failure, Going Concern, Liquidity, Management Mitigation Plans, Profitability, Solvency, Uncertainty
