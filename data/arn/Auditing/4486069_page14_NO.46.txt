Abstract

In a highly influential analysis, Lawrence, Minutti-Meza, and Zhang (2011), LMZ henceforth, undertake modified replications of prior studies addressing relation between the use of a Big N auditor and various “accounting quality” measures/consequences. They interpret failures to replicate statistical significance outcomes after imposition of matching design sample constraints as reflecting Big N effect “insignificance”. This outcome leads it to claim that existing findings largely reflect difference in client attributes. This study, in contrast, approaches the LMZ setting as a matter better addressed from an estimation perspective. That is, it addresses where the LMZ evidence locates studied Big N effects. It shows that there is little substantive difference, beyond lower precisions of matching based estimates, between LMZ’s matching based estimates and those produced by non-matching designs. More generally, the analysis illustrates how misunderstanding of statistical significance and insignificance outcomes and neglecting statistical inference fundamentals broadly compromises accounting research integrity.

Keywords: Audit Quality, statistical insignificance
