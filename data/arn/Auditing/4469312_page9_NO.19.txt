Abstract

Using a novel metric of audit-related expertise: the co-signing experience of a lead partner with other partners over the preceding five years, this study investigates the relationship between such experience and audit quality. We find positive effects of co-signing experience on audit quality proxies, as evidenced by positive associations with modified audit opinions and negative associations with absolute discretionary current accruals and bank loan spreads. Such effects appear mainly for junior partners co-signing with senior partners and are more pronounced for clients with highly complex audits. In addition, our findings suggest that a lead partner can benefit not only from co-signing with “masters” (industry specialists) but also from non-masters (non-industry specialists). Overall, these findings expand partner-level research to new angles of analysis.

Keywords: Co-signing experience; audit quality; partner-level research
