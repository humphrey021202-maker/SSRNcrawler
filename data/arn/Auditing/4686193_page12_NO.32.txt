Abstract

Public company audits serve the public interest as they enhance the credibility of financial statements for participants in the capital markets. Doing so necessitates that market participants rely on the reasonableness of auditors’ professional judgments. Our research proposes a systematic approach for researchers to identify areas where auditors’ professional judgments warrant interventions aimed at improving future professional judgments. To that end, we analyze 271 auditing deficiencies through a professional judgment lens to identify which stage of the professional judgment processes most likely fell short in each case. Our findings offer insights to academics regarding where to focus future research efforts aimed at improving auditors’ professional judgments throughout the audit.

Keywords: Professional judgment, auditing deficiencies, cognitive processing
