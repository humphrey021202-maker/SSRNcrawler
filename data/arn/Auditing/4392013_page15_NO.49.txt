Abstract

We examine the Big 4 firms’ response to evolving partner qualification requirements in China. By the end of 2017, at least 80 percent of the Big 4 partners were required to hold CICPA qualifications instead of foreign ones; however, this requirement did not apply to local firms. Over a 14-year period around the regulatory change, we document that the Big 4 firms expanded their partnership and strategically promoted local talent to junior audit report signer positions, primarily to serve new clients. Next, we fail to find systematic evidence of decreased audit quality among clients of either the Big 4 or local firms. However, we document that the Big 4 firms lost market share and reduced their audit fee premiums. Our study sheds light on the Big 4’s response to a unique regulation impacting human capital allocation, leveling the playing field for local competitors while maintaining audit quality.

Keywords: Big 4, Localization Rule, Licensing, China, Audit Quality, Auditor Human Capital
