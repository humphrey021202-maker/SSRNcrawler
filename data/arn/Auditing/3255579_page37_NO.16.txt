Abstract

This paper examines how auditor extra-billing and the quality of the auditor-board member relationship affects client-initiated auditor changes. Extra-billing is an auditor billing practice where the auditor invoices a higher amount than originally negotiated with the client. Although extra-billing is common in audit practice, it has not yet received much attention in audit research. Understanding audit as a professional service, we conceptualize extra-billing as a factor that is instrumental in creating or preventing bonding, which influences the repeat purchasing behaviour of a client, such as retaining an incumbent auditor. Seventy-eight board members responsible for audit matters completed a case that varied auditor extra-billing (no extra-billing or extra-billing) and the quality of the auditor-board member relationship (good or bad relationship). The results show that both extra-billing and a bad auditor-board member relationship increase the likelihood of a client-initiated auditor change. These results have important implications for auditors, auditees, and audit regulators.

Keywords: Audit Committee, Board Members, Extra-Billing, Auditor-Board Member Relationship, Auditor Switching, Audit Fee
