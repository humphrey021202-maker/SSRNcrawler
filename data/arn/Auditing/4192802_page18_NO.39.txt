Abstract

We examine whether auditors respond to cybersecurity risks by investing more heavily in cybersecurity human capital. Additionally, we explore auditors’ role in helping their non-breached clients in raising cybersecurity awareness and investing in cybersecurity personnel. We find that audit offices’ demand for cybersecurity personnel rises after their client firms experience cyber data breach events. Our evidence also implies that client firms that share the same audit office as breached firms increase their disclosure of cybersecurity risk and their demand for cybersecurity human capital. Reconciling with the Bayesian learning theory, these effects only manifest for auditors located in states that have been only sporadically exposed to data breaches. We do not find an increase in auditors’ demand for auditing staff and general IT (non-cybersecurity) personnel. Finally, we also document that clients experiencing high demand for auditors’ cybersecurity expertise are more likely to switch to auditors with this expertise.

Keywords: cybersecurity data breach, auditor, audit peer, cybersecurity human capital, cybersecurity disclosure
