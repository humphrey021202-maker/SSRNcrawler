Abstract

Conventional wisdom suggests that external auditors enhance the credibility of financial reporting both by deterring and by correcting managerial bias. In this paper, we consider circumstances where this conventional wisdom is likely to hold true and circumstances where it is not. We conduct an experiment set in the fair value estimate context using professionals with, on average, over 18 years of experience. Our experiment is unique as it includes a control condition where participants form estimates without specifically considering an impending audit and treatment conditions involving different salient audit characteristics related to auditor expertise and prior negotiation outcomes. Results confirm our expectation that specifically anticipating an impending audit can sometimes increase managerial bias versus when auditing is less salient. Surprisingly, we do not observe an incremental deterrence effect of auditing on managerial bias in our setting. We also provide insight into how managerial behavior in anticipation of an audit corresponds to managers’ expectations about how auditing will lead to the correction of amounts ultimately reported in the financial statements and, in turn, the potential for missing an important earnings benchmark.

Keywords: fair value estimates, manager bias, auditing, deterrence
