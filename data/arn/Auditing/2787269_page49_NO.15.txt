Abstract

Our study reports evidence on the dynamic effects of client switches on auditor reputations and fee premia. Offices of large accounting firms that lose (gain) major industry clients experience a reputation shock leading to more same-industry client losses (gains) over the next two years. There is also a shift in audit fees charged to other same-industry clients when a major client loss (gain) results in an audit office losing (gaining) city-level industry leadership. A major client loss or gain also creates a short-term capacity shock to an audit office’s ability to supply high-quality audits. However, there is no evidence of reputation spillovers to other-industry clients in the audit office, or to clients in other offices of the accounting firm.

Keywords: Auditor Reputation; Auditor Changes; Audit Fees; Earnings Quality

JEL Classification: D40, L11, M20, M40
