Abstract

We test whether auditor reputation affects client firm values using the canonical setting of Arthur Andersen’s collapse. Using high-frequency intraday data, we examine market reactions to Andersen’s January 10, 2002 admission of document shredding and its March 14, 2002 criminal indictment. Within narrow [-5, +10] minute windows, Andersen clients experienced statistically significant and economically non-trivial negative returns—about 12 basis points after the shredding admission and 11 basis points after the indictment—relative to other Big N clients. These effects remain robust after controlling for intraday oil price movements and are not attributable to Andersen’s Houston office concentration or to routine market volatility. Cumulative return plots demonstrate that these differentials persisted for at least one hour after the announcements, indicating sustained market recognition rather than transient noise. Our findings provide well-identified evidence that capital markets recognize auditor-specific reputation shocks in real time, resolving prior ambiguity in the literature. Because our design prioritizes identification, the estimated magnitudes represent lower bounds of reputation damage rather than total effects.

Keywords: Auditor reputation, Arthur Andersen, Event studies, Intraday returns
