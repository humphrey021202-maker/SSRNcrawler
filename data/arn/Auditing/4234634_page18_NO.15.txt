Abstract

Recent research on initial fee discounting attributes prior evidence to measurement error related to audit fees' partial-year reporting. However, DeAngelo (1981) suggests fee discounting occurs when multiple potential successor auditors bid for the client. The SEC has continuing concerns about Big N firms' initial fee discounting pricing out smaller audit firms. We examine both issues using SEC disclosures of audit firm changes to identify cases with multiple potential successor auditors, which suggests more competition for the client. Using this sample, we find that successor audit firms discount audit fees in the first full year following the auditor change, and the fee discounting continues until at least the second full year of the engagement. Results also suggest Big N successor firms discount fees to win new engagements from smaller successor audit firms. Audit fee discounting occurs when companies dismiss their audit firm rather than when audit firms resign. Finally, we find no evidence of impaired audit quality for the two years following the auditor change.

Keywords: Audit fees, competitive bidding, audit firm change, audit firm turnover
