Abstract

This study investigates the impact of negative environmental, social, and governance (ESG) incidents on audit fees. Negative ESG incidents are defined as violations of government regulations related to ESG issues. Using a large sample of Chinese listed firms from 2003 to 2021, we find that client firms experiencing a higher number of ESG incidents in a year are charged significantly higher audit fees. Further analysis reveals that increased media attention and the disclosure of key audit matters are two underlying mechanisms driving this relationship. Heterogeneity tests indicate that social and governance incidents exert a stronger effect on audit fees than environmental incidents. Additionally, the impact is attenuated for auditors with longer tenure, larger audit firms, and firms with stronger ESG performance. Our findings suggest that auditors incorporate negative ESG incidents into their pricing decisions.

Keywords: ESG incidents, Audit fees, Media attention, Key Audit Matters
