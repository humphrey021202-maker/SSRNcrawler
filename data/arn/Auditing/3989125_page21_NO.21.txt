Abstract

Despite evidence suggesting multitasking reduces performance, multitasking is unavoidable and pervasive in the audit setting. Members of engagement teams often work on multiple engagements simultaneously and their work on one engagement is frequently interrupted by the demands of another engagement. To facilitate multitasking, engagement team communications have extended beyond face-to-face interactions to computer-mediated communication technologies. However, little is known about the performance of multitasking teams under these alternative modes of communication (face-to-face, discussion board, and chatroom). This article summarizes Sidgman, Brown, and Brazel (2021) which demonstrates that, when multitasking, the performance of audit teams communicating face-to-face is greater than the performance of teams using computer-mediated communication (discussion board and chatroom). Contrary to expectations, the authors find that experimental participants’ familiarity with, and preference for, chatroom features (which are similar to text messaging) may have offset the benefits prior studies have attributed to discussion boards (which are similar to email).

Keywords: audit team performance, chatroom, computer-mediated communication, discussion board, face-to-face, multitasking
