Abstract

Audit senior associates are essential to audit production, yet we know little about how they experience their organizational role. We interview 45 U.S.-based audit seniors and report how they experience a multifaceted role, with persistent tensions between contradictory yet interrelated objectives. Our findings challenge the conventional academic perspective that treats seniors as experienced workpaper preparers. Our analysis of seniors’ experience applies micro-level Paradox Theory and incorporates theory on middle power and coping with stress. Seniors sometimes work around tensions with reductive strategies that minimize paradoxical tensions. Other times, when seniors perceive more coping options and resources, they work through tensions by integrating multiple objectives, and they make sense of paradoxical tensions
as inherent to their role. We offer new avenues for researchers to consider the distinct psychological experience of the senior role and offer insights for audit firms that seek to support seniors in their work.

Keywords: audit teams, superior-subordinate relationships, power, audit quality
