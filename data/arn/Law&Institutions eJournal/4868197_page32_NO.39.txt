Abstract

We examine whether mandatory disclosures can lead to a crowding out of voluntary disclosures about alternative, albeit related, information. Using the CEO pay ratio disclosure as our setting,  we investigate whether CEOs responded to this mandate by reducing voluntary discussion about their firms' human capital management practices when interacting with stakeholders during conference calls. We find robust evidence that managers decreased their voluntary discussions about human capital management after their mandatory pay ratio disclosures. Our results show that intentional topic avoidance by CEOs is the most likely mechanism, as analysts' discussions about these topics are unchanged after the pay ratio disclosures. Further, we find that reducing the amount of discussion given to human capital topics during conference calls is negatively related to stock returns, but it also reduces unfavorable media attention, which potentially benefits the CEO. Overall, our study reveals an unintended consequence of mandatory human capital disclosures and highlights CEOs' personal incentives to disengage with outsiders.

Keywords: CEO Pay Ratio, Conference Calls, Human Capital, Disclosure Policy
