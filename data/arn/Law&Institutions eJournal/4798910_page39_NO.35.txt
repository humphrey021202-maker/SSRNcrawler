Abstract

We investigate whether excess control rights of controlling shareholders affect bank risk-taking. We exploit the 2015-2016 Brazilian crisis as an exogenous shock to the incentives of controlling shareholders to expropriate minority investors. We use a unique database of Brazilian banks that allows us to measure excess control rights stemming both from dual class shares and from pyramidal structures. Our results show that different control enhancing mechanisms (dual class shares and pyramids) affect risk-taking heterogeneously. While dual class shares decrease bank risk-taking, the results for pyramidal structures are less conclusive. Furthermore, the effects of dual class shares became more pronounced in times of crisis. Our findings contribute to the literature of corporate governance in banks and have implications for bank regulation.

Keywords: Risk, ownership structure, Corporate Governance, crisis, banks
