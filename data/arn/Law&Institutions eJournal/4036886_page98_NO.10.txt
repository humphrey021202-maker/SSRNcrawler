Abstract

We study the information gathering process around mergers by examining IP addresses accessing Form 8-K filings for merger agreements. This allows us to measure how attention varies across mergers and how this attention relates to portfolio decisions and merger outcomes. We find that certain attention, specifically from investment management firms, reveals characteristics about the merger, such as the eventual withdrawal of the deal or the involvement of an activist. Investment firm attention to a merger is related to portfolio changes, especially when that attention is new. Finally, we relate the soft information about the merger revealed in the text to both the decision to learn about it and the eventual withdrawal of the deal.

Keywords: Mergers, Information Acquisition, Soft Information, Institutional Investors, Activism

JEL Classification: G14, G23, G34, D83
