Abstract

We introduce the concept of a sustainable transition phase to reconcile the growing prevalence of sustainability-motivated portfolio tilting with its seemingly limited short-term impact. Using granular sustainability information of 9,130 firms across 77 countries, we develop a novel method to separate firms’ sustainable aspirations from sustainable performance, enabling us to position firms along their sustainable transition trajectory. We find that portfolio tilting enhances firms’ sustainable performance through a four-step process. First, sustainable investors disproportionately tilt toward firms in the early stages of transition — those with high aspirations but low current performance. Second, this reallocation is associated with lower financing costs for those firms. Third, lower capital costs spur greater sustainable commitments and investment in green innovation. Fourth, firms increasingly fulfill these heightened commitments, mitigating concerns of greenwashing. These findings demonstrate how portfolio tilting can drive long-run improvements in environmental and social outcomes, even if short-run effects appear modest.

Keywords: Socially responsible investing (SRI), cost of capital, promised to realized sustainable performance, corporate social responsibility
