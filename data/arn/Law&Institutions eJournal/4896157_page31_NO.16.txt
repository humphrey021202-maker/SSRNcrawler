Abstract

We analyze the effect of real-time information availability on performance in a high-pressure setting. An open question in management control is how the amount of real-time information provided during task execution influences decision-making. Using high-volume data from Formula One and a natural experiment from a radio communication restriction, we test competing arguments about decision quality, autonomy, and information overload. Our findings indicate that, on average, increased real-time information availability does not necessarily enhance performance—drivers perform better with less real-time information. However, this restriction comes with costs, including larger gaps between teammates, adjustments in pit stop strategies, and more unfinished races, accidents, and engine failures. Cross-sectional tests show that racetrack complexity, experience and past performance influence these effects, while a matching analysis mitigates potential concerns about compositional biases. These findings highlight the complexities of real-time information availability in decision-making, with implications for management control.
