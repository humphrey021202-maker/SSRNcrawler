Abstract

Purpose – The Japanese Sarbanes-Oxley Act (J-SOX) was implemented for the fiscal years ending on or after March 31, 2009. This study examines the effect of J-SOX on accounting conservatism and income smoothing behavior in Japanese firms.
Design/methodology/approach – We consider Japanese listed firms with fiscal years ending on March 31 in 2007 and 2008 (March 31 in 2009 and 2010) as the pre-J-SOX (post-J-SOX) sample. We perform multiple regression analyses with a dummy variable for the post-J-SOX period to compare the levels of accounting conservatism and income smoothing between the pre- and post-J-SOX periods.
Findings – We find that accounting conservatism has increased and income smoothing has decreased following J-SOX implementation. This finding suggests that financial reporting transparency in Japanese firms may have increased after the implementation of J-SOX.
Originality/value – To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to analyze the effect of J-SOX on accounting conservatism and income smoothing behavior in Japanese firms. Although previous studies indicate that firms’ earnings in Japan are less conservative and more smoothed than those in other countries, this study complements them by demonstrating that Japanese firms’ earnings in the post-J-SOX period are more conservative and less smoothed than in the pre-J-SOX period.
