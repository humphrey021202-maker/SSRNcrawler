Abstract

This paper extends longitudinal survey data collected in 2015 and 2020 about accounting faculty perceptions of the accounting publication process. Prior studies document poor perceptions across all measured variables. The evidence from this data collection shows that on every question, results are as negative, or more negative than in the past. The opinions are strongly shared across more than 1,100 respondents. Many support stronger action from sponsoring organizations, such as higher acceptance rates and broader recognition of journals in tenure and promotion decisions. We also document the disruptive role of generative AI in accounting research. Nearly two-thirds of faculty already use these tools, another 17 percent plan to adopt them, and most expect their use to become unavoidable within five years. Together, these findings portray a strong collective belief of a discipline mired in dysfunction, but willing to try new technologies.
