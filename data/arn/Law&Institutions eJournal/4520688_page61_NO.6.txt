Abstract

This paper examines how corporations respond to ESG ratings criteria. We study a leading ESG rater and find that firms’ reported performance on certain criteria improves in the same month the rater updates its model to place more emphasis on the criteria. We find no evidence that reported performance predicts real changes in firms’ ESG behavior. Rather, the improvements appear cosmetic and are stronger among firms with ESG-conscious stakeholders. Overall, the results indicate that firms influence reported signals about their quality when they are allowed to engage with information intermediaries during the information production process.

Keywords: ESG, Greenwashing, Second-party opinion, Information production

JEL Classification: G34, G24, D22
