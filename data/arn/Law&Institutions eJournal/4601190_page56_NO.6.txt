Abstract

We examine whether the adoption of the current expected credit losses (CECL) model, which reflects forward-looking information in loan loss provisions (LLP), improves banks’ information production. Consistent with better information production, we find changes in CECL banks' financial reporting and operations. First, these banks' loan loss provisions become timelier and better reflect future local economic conditions. Second, CECL banks disclose longer, more forward-looking, and more quantitative LLP information. Lastly, they have fewer loan defaults after adopting CECL. These improvements are greater for banks that invest more in CECL-related information systems and human capital and even more salient for larger banks. Our findings suggest that banks' information production is improved under a more forward-looking accounting standard. However, these improvements are greater for banks with more resources to invest in related technology and human capital.

Keywords: Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL), Banks, Information Production, Loan Loss Provisioning
