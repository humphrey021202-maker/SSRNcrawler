Abstract

We explore the bidirectional relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and firm performance among non-financial firms in Nigeria from 2010 to 2022, addressing the financial trade-offs associated with CSR in an emerging market. Given mixed evidence on CSR's impact on profitability and the limited research in resource-constrained environments, this study aims to clarify how CSR affects profitability, as measured by return on assets, and vice versa. Employing a simultaneous equation modeling framework, estimated via System Generalized Method of Moments (System GMM), the study addresses endogeneity and heterogeneity to produce robust results. Findings reveal a significant negative impact of CSR disclosure on profitability, implying that CSR may impose immediate costs on firms, reducing short-term returns. Furthermore, lower profitability drives firms to intensify CSR efforts, potentially as a strategic response to enhance reputation and stakeholder support. These results suggest that CSR engagement involves financial trade-offs, with firms balancing short-term costs against long-term reputational benefits, particularly relevant in contexts like Nigeria where CSR lacks regulatory backing. This study offers valuable insights into the CSR-profitability dynamics in an emerging market context, providing actionable information for managers, policymakers, and investors on navigating the complexities of CSR in financially constrained settings.
