Abstract

In this study, we investigate the effect of the marital status of CEOs on their compensation structure for the period of 1992-2008. The results indicate that married CEOs have higher compensation than single CEOs, after controlling for a set of firm characteristics and CEO traits. Our results are robust using the alternative measures and estimation of compensation structure.

Keywords: Marriage; Compensation Structure; Discrimination
