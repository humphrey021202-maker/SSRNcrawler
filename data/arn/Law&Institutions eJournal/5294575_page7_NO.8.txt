Abstract

This report presents a comprehensive financial and strategic analysis of Tata Motors Limited (TML), benchmarked against its key Indian automotive peers: Mahindra & Mahindra, Maruti Suzuki, Ashok Leyland, and Eicher Motors. The study adopts a corporate finance perspective to evaluate investment decisions, risk-return dynamics, capital structure, value creation, and the cost of capital. Tata Motors, through its diversified portfolio-including commercial vehicles, passenger cars, electric vehicles, and luxury brands under Jaguar Land Rover (JLR)-has undergone significant transformation in the last two decades, including global expansion, strategic restructuring, and a focused push toward electrification. The analysis highlights the company's revenue leadership driven by JLR, improving financial health post-COVID, and targeted deleveraging efforts. Comparisons reveal that while Maruti Suzuki maintains profitability and conservative financials, Mahindra is strengthening its EV ambitions and operational efficiency. Ashok Leyland and Eicher Motors, though niche players, exhibit contrasting approaches-cyclical exposure versus premium niche focus. The report also assesses capital budgeting practices, where Tata's EV investments and JLR turnaround are evaluated using DCF and real options frameworks. Risk-return profiles, valuation multiples, and cost of capital structures are dissected to explain market perceptions and stock price dynamics. Furthermore, Tata's sustainability and ESG-led strategies are positioned as long-term value drivers. By integrating strategic foresight with financial rigor, this study concludes that Tata Motors, despite historical volatility, is structurally better positioned for long-term growth. The report offers valuable insights for investors, analysts, and policymakers examining the evolving Indian automotive landscape and the global competitiveness of Tata Motors.
