Abstract

The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of corporate opacity on the relationship between family-control and firm’s cost of debt. Using S&P500 index data, over the period 2010 to 2017 this study finds that family-control is associated with lower firm’s cost of debt. Then, we find that corporate opacity negatively associated to the firm’s cost of debt. However, the effect of the interaction variable between corporate opacity and family-control on cost of debt is insignificant. Finally, using fsQCA, we find that a higher firm’s cost of debt implies a lower controlling families’ and a higher corporate opacity.

Keywords: Family Control, Corporate opacity, fsQCA, S&P500, cost of debt
