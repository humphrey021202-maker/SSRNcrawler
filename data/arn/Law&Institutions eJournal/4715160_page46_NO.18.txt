Abstract

This paper examines whether and how timely reporting of insider trading affects insider trading profits. Guided by an analytical model, we predict that timely reporting of insider trading can increase insider trading profits through better coordination of such trading. Studying the accelerated reporting of insider transactions under Section 403 of the Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) Act of 2002, we find evidence that insider trading profits increase by about 0.071% after timelier reporting of insider transactions. Furthermore, the increase in profits exhibits a hump-shaped relation with the internal information asymmetry among insiders after accelerated reporting. The increase is also more pronounced among insiders with more social connections. Overall, our results suggest that timelier reporting of insider trading may increase insider trading profits through improved trading coordination.

Keywords: Insider trading, Accelerated reporting, Security regulation.

JEL Classification: G14; G30; K22
