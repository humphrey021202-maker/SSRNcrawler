Abstract

Economic policy uncertainty (EPU) has been shown to influence various corporate decisions; however, its effect on earnings management remains underexplored. This study investigates how EPU affects firms’ earnings management using panel data from listed companies in Mainland China and Hong Kong between 2007 and 2021.For each region, normalized variables on firm-level is applied, followed by pooled and panel regressions. Results show that across four earnings management measures (EM1–EM4), the EPU coefficient is significantly positive in both samples, indicating that firms generally increase earnings management under higher policy uncertainty to maintain financial stability and market expectations. These findings highlight the universal effect of EPU on earnings management and provide implications for accounting standards and regulatory policies.

Keywords: Economic Policy Uncertainty, Earnings Management, Corporate Behavior, Policy Risk
