Abstract

We argue for an integrated and decision-oriented enterprise risk management system (ERM), where organizations focus on the drivers of value, rather than risk minimization and make use of quantitative risk aggregation techniques based on the best available information. Design/methodology/approach: The analysis is structured along seven areas we see as crucial for the development of ERM systems, supported by a structures literature analysis. Findings: Our literature review makes clear that of the seven areas presented in this article, especially risk aggregation, risk quantification and supporting decision-making are only covered by a minority of the publications. Practical implications: The paper offers valuable insights on how risk management can be linked with strategic decision-making by making use of risk aggregation techniques. Originality: Supported by our literature review, we present seven areas in which more effective risk governance and strengthened resilience can be created. By including these areas, we not only focus on one aspect but take a holistic view on ERM, including cultural, organizational and technical aspects. These arease are also grounded in a robus enterprise framework we lay out.

Keywords: Enterprise risk management, risk governance, risk aggregation, value-based management, corporate planning, resilience
