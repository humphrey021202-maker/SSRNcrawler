Abstract

This study examines whether the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and enabling technologies leads to improvements in firm productivity. Using DEA-Malmquist model, we estimate firm productivity change and its two components, technical progress and relative efficiency. We measure AI usage intensity using a textual measure of AI keywords disclosed in annual reports. Results show that AI usage intensity is positively associated with productivity growth, primarily through gains in relative efficiency (catching-up effect) rather than technical progress (innovation effect). Furthermore, large and high-tech firms gain productivity growth through technical progress, while small and medium enterprises and non-high-tech firms benefit from improvements in relative efficiency. The impact of AI on both components is stronger in regions with higher marketization and intellectual property protection. Additional analyses show that capital efficiency mediates the effect of AI on productivity change, technical progress, and relative efficiency change, whereas R&D efficiency mediates its effect on technical progress.

Keywords: Artificial Intelligence, Productivity Change, Technical Progress, Relative Efficiency Change
