Abstract

This study investigates the practical challenges in implementing the converged revenue recognition standards-IFRS 15 and Ind AS 115-across key economic sectors in India. Although these standards provide a unified, principle-based framework centered on the transfer of control and a five-step model, their application varies significantly across industries due to differences in contractual arrangements, business models, and regulatory oversight. Through a sector-by-sector analysis covering manufacturing, logistics, retail, financial services, utilities, and technology, this report highlights nuanced implementation complexities such as identifying distinct performance obligations, estimating variable consideration, contract modifications, and principal-agent distinctions. It also explores associated disclosure requirements and regulatory expectations, drawing on insights from NFRA circulars, SEBI filings, and industry case studies. The findings suggest that while convergence enhances comparability and transparency, it also introduces judgment-driven risks, including potential earnings management through strategic allocation of transaction price and revenue timing. The report emphasizes that consistent application, documentation of key estimates, and integration with related standards (e.g., Ind AS 116, Ind AS 109, IFRIC 12) are essential to faithful representation. Notably, sectors like retail and tech face high variability in revenue streams, whereas regulated sectors like utilities encounter disclosure and classification challenges. By blending academic literature, regulatory guidance, and company disclosures, the study offers comprehensive insights into the evolving landscape of revenue recognition in India and underscores the need for tailored governance and audit responses to sector-specific complexities.
