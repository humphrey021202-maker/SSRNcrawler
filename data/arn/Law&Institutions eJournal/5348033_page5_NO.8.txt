Abstract

This study, developed under the ICAC-ASEPUC 2024 agreement, explores the current state of artificial intelligence (AI) adoption in the audit profession, identifying key benefits, challenges, and perceptions among professionals in Spain and other countries. Based on a survey of 530 auditing professionals across firms of different sizes, the report provides a comprehensive overview of how AI is being integrated into audit workflows, the tools in use, and the impact on client relationships and regulatory frameworks.

The results indicate a growing interest in AI across all levels of auditing firms, though the degree of implementation and employee training varies widely depending on firm size. Big-4 firms lead in strategic integration and internal development of AI tools, while small and medium-sized firms face barriers such as limited resources, lack of specialized talent, and cybersecurity concerns. Generative tools like ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot are widely used, along with non-generative tools such as CaseWare IDEA and ACL Analytics.

AI is primarily applied to document review, automation of routine tasks, and data analytics, with growing relevance in fraud detection and compliance. The study also highlights the importance of ethical oversight, regulatory development, and the need to foster trust in AI systems among clients and professionals.

Ultimately, the report reveals that AI has the potential to reshape the audit profession by enhancing efficiency, precision, and strategic analysis. However, successful adoption depends on firm-wide strategies, adequate training, and regulatory guidance to ensure ethical, secure, and equitable implementation.

Keywords: Artificial Intelligence (AI), Audit profession, Technological adoption, AI tools in auditing, Professional training and upskilling
