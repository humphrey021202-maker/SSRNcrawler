Abstract

There are widespread concerns about corporate influence on government policy-making. We examine firms’ use of investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS), which allows companies to challenge foreign regulations through international arbitration. Using comprehensive ISDS data, we document three main findings. First, publicly traded firms are more likely to initiate disputes against industry-wide foreign regulations, and these disputes take significantly longer to resolve, consistent with strategic delay tactics and regulatory deterrence. Second, public firms face reduced free-riding incentives because they hold greater industry stakes and generate positive stock returns when filing disputes. Third, public firms disproportionately target regulations that protect foreign stakeholders, reflecting pressure to prioritize domestic shareholder interests. Cross-sectional tests show these patterns are strongest in countries with strong shareholder protections. Our findings suggest that ISDS serves as a channel for public firms to influence foreign policy-making in ways that favor domestic shareholders over foreign stakeholder protections.

Keywords: Public firms, regulatory challenges, corporate political influence, shareholder-stakeholder conflict, investor-state dispute settlement
