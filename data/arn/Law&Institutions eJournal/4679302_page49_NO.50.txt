Abstract

Since 2012, the European Commission has advocated for employee share ownership plans (ESOPs) to enhance corporate governance. This study examines ESOPs' empirical impact on bank efficiency in the European banking sector. Despite an 88% adoption rate in large European corporations (Mathieu, 2022), the literature on ESOPs remains polarized. Using a dataset of 113 listed banks from 16 Western European countries (2011–2019), our findings reveal a causal relationship between ESOPs and bank efficiency, with a significant negative impact observed only in opaque banks. This adverse effect transcends ownership structures, highlighting the pivotal role of bank transparency. Our study contributes nuanced insights, emphasizing ESOPs' role in corporate governance conflicts and suggesting policy implications for enhancing corporate transparency.

Keywords: Corporate governance, Bank Efficiency, Employee Ownership, ESOPs
