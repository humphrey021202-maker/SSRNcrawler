Abstract

To encourage banks to accommodate distressed borrowers during the Covid-19 pandemic, regulators redacted loan modification activity from each bank's public regulatory filings so that banks could modify loans free from capital market scrutiny. This study examines whether capital market scrutiny does in fact discourage banks from making loan modifications, as posited by bank regulators. We assess the effect of capital market scrutiny primarily by comparing publicly traded banks to private banks. We find no evidence of significant differences in loan modification activity between public and private banks in a long sample period prior to the pandemic nor in a shorter sample period during the pandemic. Overall, the results do not support the idea that suppressing information about loan modifications encourages additional modification activity.

Keywords: banking, lending, troubled debt restructurings, loan modifications, COVID, pandemic, disclosure
