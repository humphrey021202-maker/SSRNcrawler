Abstract

Corporate environmental disclosures are largely based on voluntary certifications like labels and ratings. The paper shows in a voluntary disclosure model that important issues of greenwashing arise in this system, for it enables dirty firms to take advantage of consumers' wishful thinking. Whenever disclosure is costly, consumers cannot make any inference on quality by reasoning about disclosure incentives. The resulting uncertainty gives bite to consumers' wishful thinking, enabling sellers to greenwash consumers by withholding information. This greenwashing unravels the green market and can lead to environmental market failures even when consumers are strongly environmentally concerned. The results advance the foundations for mandatory disclosure as a high-impact intervention for the green transition.

Keywords: Voluntary disclosure; greenwashing; disclosure costs; quality certification; motivated beliefs; lemons problem
