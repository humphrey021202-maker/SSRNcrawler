Abstract

Under limited resources and inelastic budgets, opportunistic trading may shift from insiders targeted by the SEC to non-targeted insiders who perceive lower costs of opportunistic trading. We show that opportunistic insider trading is displaced (i.e., not deterred) within the industry after an SEC enforcement action. Specifically, non-targeted insiders in the same industry increase trading just prior to upcoming earnings announcements and sell more shares just prior to upcoming bad earnings news after an enforcement action. Our results suggest that non-targeted insiders at industry peers are more likely to exploit material, non-public information for personal gain after an SEC enforcement action.

Keywords: SEC enforcement action; insider trading; deterrence; displacement

JEL Classification: G14; G38; K22
