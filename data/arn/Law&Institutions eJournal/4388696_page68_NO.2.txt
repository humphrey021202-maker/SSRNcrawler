Abstract

We examine how government impacts firm performance through an agency-centered lens. Using Exploratory Factor Analysis on six agency-level variables—enforcement actions, budget variables, and regulatory text—we construct an annual Agency Activity Index (AAI) for the EPA, FDA, OSHA, and SEC. Higher AAI scores predict weaker firm operating performance. Greater firm exposure to the agency strengthens the relationship. To identify causality, we apply difference-in-differences analyses using regulatory and deregulatory shocks that generate shifts in AAI. Finally, we conduct event studies on the Supreme Court’s review of the Chevron doctrine, capturing market reactions to potential limits on agency authority.

Keywords: Federal Agencies, Corporate Performance
