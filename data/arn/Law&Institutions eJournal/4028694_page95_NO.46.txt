Abstract

We study whether discussions between financial analysts and managers in earnings conference calls are informative about the quality of firms’ internal control systems. Low internal control quality harms information quality and impedes accurate forecasts of firm performance. We argue that analysts address settings of low information quality by asking thematically different questions. Using a topic modeling approach, we find that conference call discussion topics are incrementally informative about internal control quality, beyond determinants identified by prior research. The discussion topics’ informativeness regarding internal control quality is higher when management forecasts are less accurate, suggesting that analysts respond to low information quality. We also show that discussion topics are thematically linked to the nature of internal control material weaknesses, suggesting that analysts address specific issues that influence information quality. Taken together, our results suggest that analysts may serve as an external monitor of internal controls, thereby safeguarding financial reporting quality.

Keywords: internal control, material weaknesses, financial analysts, earnings conference calls, auditing
