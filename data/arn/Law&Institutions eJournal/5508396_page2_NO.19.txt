Abstract

This study explores the relationships between investor sentiment, audit tenure, and auditor rotation with accounting conservatism in non-financial companies listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange from 2012 to 2023. Using total accruals scaled by total assets as a proxy for conservatism, the research evaluates whether higher investor sentiment, longer audit tenure, and auditor rotation enhance conservative financial reporting. The findings reveal that investor sentiment has a weak but positive effect on conservatism, consistent with prior research suggesting that high sentiment encourages timely recognition of economic losses. Contrary to expectations, audit tenure is negatively associated with conservatism, indicating that prolonged auditor engagements may erode independence and reduce conservative reporting. Auditor rotation shows a significant negative relationship with accruals, indirectly supporting its role in promoting stricter oversight and conservative practices. The study contributes to the literature on financial reporting and audit quality by highlighting the complex dynamics of sentiment and audit practices. Limitations and avenues for future research, including cross-country studies and the use of alternative conservatism measures, are discussed to encourage further exploration of these critical relationships.
