Abstract

The major stock exchanges define controlled companies as public firms in which an individual, group, or company holds over half the voting power. Despite agency concerns that controlling shareholders may not act in minority shareholders’ interests, controlled companies can opt out of many board independence requirements. Independent directors at controlled companies are less experienced, have fewer connections, and are paid less than those at similar firms. Thus, these independent directors have little power and less financial reward. In contrast, inside directors are more experienced and have more connections. Firms claiming the controlled company exemption also exhibit lower firm value, greater information asymmetry, and underinvestment. Our results are consistent with reduced monitoring and advising from less qualified independent directors outweighing any potential positive effects from insiders’ greater qualifications. These findings are timely given the rise of controlled companies and recent court cases dealing with agency issues in these firms.
