Abstract

Our study examines how constituency statutes influence corporate tax avoidance. These statelevel laws allow corporate boards to consider the interests of all stakeholders, not just shareholders, in their decisions. Using recent econometric advances in staggered difference-indifferences estimations, we find that after these laws are adopted, firms affected by these laws reduce their tax avoidance. This effect is stronger in firms that previously avoid more taxes or have lower CSR ratings. Our study provides valuable insights into how stakeholder orientation influences tax behavior, offering practical implications for both corporate managers and policymakers.

Keywords: H26, K22, M14, M41 CSR, stakeholder orientation, tax avoidance, staggered difference-in-differences
