Abstract

We examine the impact of COVID-19 on changes in firm value, and the moderating role of firm-level sustainability performance on this relationship. We find that firms domiciled in countries where the COVID-19 impact is more devastating experience greater decline in firm value. The negative impact of COVID-19 on firm value is less pronounced for firms with better sustainability performance. Firms domiciled in countries with a higher level of environmental- and stakeholder-value-oriented culture experience less decline in firm value from the impact of COVID-19. Findings suggest a firm’s stakeholder-value orientation contributes to preserving a firm’s value when general stakeholder value declines.

Keywords: COVID-19, Coronavirus, Stakeholder value, Firm value, Sustainability performance; Environmental-value culture; Cross-country
