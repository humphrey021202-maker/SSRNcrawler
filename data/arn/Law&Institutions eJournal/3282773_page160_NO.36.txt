Abstract

We analyse the effects of changes in regulatory capital requirements under Basel III on the dynamics of bank shareholder equity. Evidence from managerial and regulatory reports shows that bank shareholder equity stands between Basel III regulatory capital requirements and managerial pursuit of equity economising strategies. Shareholder value strategies see shareholders as the equity investment remuneration recipients. Regulators, in turn, address them as equity investment providers. With opposing cash streams, one concept put the other to a test. The paper visualises this conflict by analysing the actual shareholder contribution to the bank equity position in nine case studies of European financial institutions between 2001 and 2017; our empirical financial analysis applies an innovative method to data extracted from financial statements, to measure these equity position evolutions and assess bank equity dynamics in light of revised regulatory capital requirements and persistent assurance of shareholder value thriving in managerial reports. The choice of in-depth analysis of a sample of relevant case studies overcomes the absence of detailed data on changes in bank equity in existing databases.
