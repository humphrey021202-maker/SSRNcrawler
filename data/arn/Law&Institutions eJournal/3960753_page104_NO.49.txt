Abstract

Given that marriage transforms people with wide-ranging and long-lasting impacts, we examine the role of CEOs' marital status on firms' cash holdings behavior. Using a large sample of US-listed firms, we find that single CEOs stockpile more cash than married ones. Our finding is robust to alternative measures of cash, controlling for various CEO characteristics, CFO influence, and tackling the endogeneity concerns. Moreover, we show that exogenous CEO turnover resulting in an appointment of single (married) CEOs increases (decreases) cash holdings. Additional results show that single-CEO firms practice a more conservative payout policy and are more likely to accumulate cash from operating and financing cash flows. Consistent with the agency theory, single CEOs extract more compensation from the accumulated cash, leading to a lower value of cash holdings. External corporate governance mechanisms mitigate the relationship between single CEOs and cash holdings. Overall, our results show that single-CEO firms are more prone to agency problems.

Keywords: Agency theory; Cash hoardings; Marital status; Upper-echelon theory; Value of cash.

JEL Classification: G23, G31, G30
