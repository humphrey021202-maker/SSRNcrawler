Abstract

The launch of the Central Data Repository required US commercial banks to submit machine-readable XBRL call reports starting in 2005, significantly reducing information processing costs for users of bank data. Using a regression discontinuity in time design, we find banks became 4% less opaque in the reporting period immediately following this regulatory technology initiative. Further, difference-in-differences estimates show independent banks, whose disclosures are self-contained, reduced opacity by 9% relative to BHC subsidiaries with more complex and consolidated disclosures. Our findings support the market discipline view, whereby banks respond to improved monitoring by increasing transparency. Cross-sectional tests, risk-taking analyses and network-based estimates confirm this interpretation and reveal modest peer effects in disclosure behavior.

Keywords: JEL Classification: G21, G28, M40, R12 banks, opacity, RegTech, peer effects
