Abstract

This study examines the debt markets’ response to mandatory corporate social responsibility (CSR) as prescribed by the Indian Companies Act 2013. Implementing this rule results in a 43 basis point
increase in yield spreads for compliant firms, counteracting the Act’s debt-reducing
provisions. The upsurge is attributed to the negative impact of mandatory CSR on
expected cash flow. Leveraging a generative artificial intelligence (AI) model, the analysis
distinguishes between mandatory CSR governance and expenditure. The former
modestly boosts the issue-to-sales ratio by 1.2%, while the latter significantly drives
the rise in yield spreads, illuminating the complex effects of mandatory CSR on debt
market behavior.

Keywords: Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), Debt Markets, Indian Companies Act 2013, Free Cash Flow.

JEL Classification: G30, M14
