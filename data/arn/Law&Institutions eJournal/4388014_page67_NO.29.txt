Abstract

This study examines the effect of common institutional ownership on corporate pension funding. We posit that a common owner’s incentive to maximize shareholder value may come at the cost of employee welfare. Consistent with this prediction, we find robust evidence that firms with common ownership experience greater pension underfunding than firms without common ownership. This effect increases with firms’ value-added activities, common owners’ shareholding, ownership duration, and portfolio size. It decreases with labor union power and managers’ own pension interests. Furthermore, we find that greater pension underfunding is associated with more employee-related corporate violations. Overall, our findings suggest that common ownership might adversely affect the welfare of a key firm stakeholder: employees.

Keywords: common ownership; defined benefit pensions; pension underfunding; employee welfare, defined benefit pensions, pension underfunding, employee welfare
