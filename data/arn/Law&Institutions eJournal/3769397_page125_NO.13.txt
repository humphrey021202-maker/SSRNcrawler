Abstract

Internal audit functions of organizations are regarded as crucial components of the combined assurance model, alongside the audit committee, management and external auditors. In this regard, internal audit plays a crucial role, insofar as it consists of experts in risk, governance and control consultancy who provide assurance to senior management and the audit committee.

Keywords: Audit, Management, economy, business, financial stability, economic crisis
