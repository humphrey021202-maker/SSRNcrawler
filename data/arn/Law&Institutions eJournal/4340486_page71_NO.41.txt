Abstract

Banking organizations are extraordinarily difficult to manage, and research and policy stakes are high for whether executive managers elicit high performances from these firms. We address whether banking executives impact bank performance for better or worse, tackling three empirical challenges. We employ exogenous external shocks that trigger managerial turnover to address identification concerns; use single-industry data to avoid biases from interindustry differences; and draw data from government-mandated reports to investigate performance channels with detail and accuracy not generally available. We find banking managers strongly improve market and accounting performance measures through increased asset turnover and improved product quality.

reflected in market values as well as accounting measures.

Keywords: corporate governance, executive turnover, banks
