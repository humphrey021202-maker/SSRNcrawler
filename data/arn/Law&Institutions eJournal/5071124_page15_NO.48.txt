Abstract

This paper examines the impact of staggered local newspaper closures on earnings management using a quasi-natural experiment with hand-collected data from 44 U.S. newspapers that closed between 1986 and 2021. Employing a difference-indifferences approach, we observed increases in both accrual-based and real earnings management by 0.9% to 4.8%, underscoring the importance of local journalism in ensuring corporate transparency. We controlled for economic variables like EPU, unemployment, and GDP, and used broadband and Craigslist entries as instrumental variables to address endogeneity. Robust methods, including placebo tests, PSM, entropy balancing, and dynamic effects analysis, validated our findings. Firms with executive remuneration linked to earnings targets engage in more earnings management when newspapers disappear. Weakened governance mechanisms, including institutional investors, financial analysts, auditors, and board qualities, also impact earnings manipulation. Firms not paying dividends, with low investment levels, financially constrained, and heavily reliant on debt are more prone to earnings management.

Keywords: Earnings Management, Corporate Monitoring
