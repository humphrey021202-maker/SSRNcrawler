Abstract

We explore the relationship between managerial incentives and environmental harm. We find that high-powered executive compensation packages can increase the odds of environmental law-breaking by 40-60% and the magnitude of environmental harm by over 100%. We document similar results for the setting of executive compensation and financial accounting misconduct. Finally, we outline some managerial and policy implications to blunt these adverse incentive effects.

Keywords: executive compensation, corporate governance, misconduct, environmental performance, accounting scandal, sustainable finance

JEL Classification: G01, G31, J33, K32
