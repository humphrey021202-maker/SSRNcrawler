Abstract

We study the role of financial report readability on stock price uncertainty in firms that meet or just beat past-year earnings (MBE firms). Our findings indicate that MBE firms that provide more readable 10-K reports experience lower stock return volatility in the month after filing. Furthermore, we observe that this effect is particularly strong in situations with higher levels of information asymmetry. Our findings suggest that firms may increase the readability of the financial reports to signal their earnings quality and distinguish themselves from other companies that meet market expectations through detrimental earnings management.

Keywords: Financial Reporting, Readability, Earnings Quality
