Abstract

This study evaluates whether employees have useful information about firms' ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) practices. Analyzing 10 million employee reviews, it reveals that 43% of reviews discuss ESG topics, with governance surprisingly receiving substantial attention. Assembling novel hard-to-manipulate ESG indicators, including emissions estimates from satellite imagery, the study finds that employees' ESG inside view is more informative about these indicators than existing ESG ratings. Moreover, the inside view appears robust to ESG cheap talk, as low-cost changes in firms' ESG commitments do not affect it, while costlier changes do. Thus, employee perspectives can help investors assess firms’ authentic ESG performance.

Keywords: ESG, greenwash, employees, NLP, Glassdoor, window-dress, investors
