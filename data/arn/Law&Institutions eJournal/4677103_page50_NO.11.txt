Abstract

We examine family firms’ cash holdings behavior compared to non-family firms. We study 133 Chilean non-financial listed firms in the period 2005-2016. Family firms maintain less cash reserves than non-family firms. Family firms with higher ownership concentration show lower cash holdings compared to non-family firms. Family firms with higher corporate reputation have lower levels of cash holdings.  Firm value is negatively related to excess cash holdings, but family firms are less punished by the market than non-family firms. Family firms show a higher speed of adjustment in cash holdings compare to non-family firms, result which confirms main findings.

Keywords: Family Firms, Cash holdings, Socioemotional Wealth, Agency Theory, Corporate Governance.
