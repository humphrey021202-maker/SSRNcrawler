Abstract

Job requirements create non-financial, off-the-job security risks for the CEO. Unmanaged, these risks potentially influence the CEO's on-the-job decisions. We study boards' decisions to adopt personal security policies to protect CEOs. One in ten S&P 500 firms disclose expenditures to protect the CEO and their family at home. High-authority CEOs receive more coverage, consistent with boards using security to manage CEO exposure to personal risk. Boards are more likely to subsequently force a protected CEO out, consistent with security providing additional monitoring capabilities. Our findings suggest that boards adopt personal security policies to address novel risk exposures faced by top decision-makers.

Keywords: personal risk, personal security, contract design, risk-taking incentives JEL Classification: J33
