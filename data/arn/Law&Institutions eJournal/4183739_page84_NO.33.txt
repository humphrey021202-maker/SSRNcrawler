Abstract

We provide novel evidence on the causal effect of CEO incentives on blockholder ownership of a firm. We instrument the change in CEO incentives using CEO stock sales and provide detailed evidence on the instrument's validity. We find that blockholders are attracted to a firm when its CEO incentives decline. The effect is mainly driven by blockholders who actively monitor and is stronger when the CEO is more likely to misbehave ex-ante. Taken together, our results support the substitution effect of incentive contracts on blockholder monitoring and help understand the determinant of blockholder ownership.

Keywords: Blockholder, CEO Incentives, Corporate Governance
