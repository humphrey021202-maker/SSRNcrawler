Abstract

Accounting comparability refers to the similarity with which similar economic events are reflected in the accounting choices of firms. Accounting comparability facilitates learning from peer firm disclosures. We show that accounting comparability is negatively associated to environmental violations. This relation is at least partly driven by learning from peer firms’ toxic release disclosures that is related to a reduction in the firms’ own toxic releases, which in turn reduces environmental violations. Our results provide novel evidence that accounting comparability facilitates green learning and therefore benefits society at large by reducing environmental harm.

Keywords: Accounting comparability, environmental violations, toxic emissions

JEL Classification: G30, G32, G34
