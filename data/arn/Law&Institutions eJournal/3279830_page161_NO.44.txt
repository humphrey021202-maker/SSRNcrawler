Abstract

Non-financial performance measures, such as Environmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”) measures, are potentially leading indicators of firms’ financial performance. I draw on the prior academic literature and the concept of ESG materiality to develop new corporate governance and ESG metrics. The new governance and ESG metrics predicted stock returns in a global investable universe over the tested period, suggesting potential investment value in curated ESG signals.

Keywords: Corporate Governance, ESG, Stock Returns, Global Equities

JEL Classification: G11, G12, G15, G30, G34, M41
