Abstract

We offer new explanations for why most independent directors continue serving on boards even after a regulatory shock drastically increases penalties for failing to detect financial misreporting. First, we show that firms’ inherent misreporting risk is an omitted explanator of directors’ decisions to stay. Second, we find that quality directors are more likely to remain after the regulatory shock when firms proactively seek to shelter directors from liability by voluntarily restating financial reports, engaging higher-quality auditors, and purchasing D&O insurance. Third, taking advantage of observable director votes, we explore the dynamics between dissent and board service. We find that dissent on accounting and reporting issues often precedes resignation rather than substituting for it. 

Keywords: independent director board service, director liability protection, director quality, director dissent, restatement, auditor switching, D&O insurance
