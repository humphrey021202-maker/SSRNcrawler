Abstract

Drawing on self-efficacy theory, this study examines the affective effects of tight budget controls-defined as, target pressure and target communication intensity-on subordinates' self-efficacy and job productivity using data from 999 Australian employees. The results show that target pressure reduces subordinates' self-efficacy by increasing negative affect (e.g., feeling anxious) and reducing positive affect (e.g., feeling enthusiastic). In contrast, target communication intensity increases subordinates' self-efficacy by improving positive affect and reducing negative affect. Furthermore, subordinates with lower self-efficacy report lower job productivity. We also find that leader psychopathy amplifies the depleting effects of target pressure on subordinates' negative affect whilst strengthening the positive effects of communication intensity on subordinates' positive affect. 

Keywords: Target pressure, Target communication intensity, Productivity, Negative and positive affect, Self-efficacy, Psychopathic personality traits
