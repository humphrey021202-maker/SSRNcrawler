Abstract

Our difference-in-differences analysis indicates that firms suffering cybersecurity breaches are associated with weakened brand capital reflected in fewer registrations, more cancelation, and fewer renewals of trademarks. We also show that cybersecurity breaches are associated with more negative news sentiments and poorer operating performance, suggesting the loss of clients’ trust being the underlying mechanism. Additional analyses show that the negative effect of cybersecurity breaches is more severe when firms have more internet advertising activities, when managers are less responsive, or when firms have poorer internal controls. Finally, cyberattacks on a firm also hurt its peers’ brand capital, suggesting a contagion effect.

Keywords: cybersecurity, trademarks, brand capital, customer trust

JEL Classification: D83, G32, O34
