Abstract

Following the accounting changes for intangibles introduced by Directive (2013/34), this article considers if Portuguese legislation merely transposes the Directive's rules or goes beyond what is required. The author also focuses on the tax treatment of these intangibles and analyses the sources of divergence between book and tax rules.
