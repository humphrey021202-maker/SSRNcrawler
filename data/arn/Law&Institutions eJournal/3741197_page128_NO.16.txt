Abstract

We investigate the environmental implications of firms’ internal control over financial reporting using data on toxic chemical waste generated by US firms to measure corporate environmental performance (CEP). We find that CEP is significantly poorer among firms with internal control weaknesses. Further, we document that CEP in such firms significantly improves following the remediation of internal control weaknesses. Additional analysis shows that the adverse environmental impact of internal control weaknesses is more pronounced in firms with lower readability and comparability in financial reporting, weaker environmental regulatory oversight, or poorer external governance mechanisms. Firms with internal control weaknesses also have higher costs of environmental regulatory enforcement caused by their noncompliance with regulations. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of effective internal control as a key determinant of CEP and illustrate the environmental effects of accounting.

Keywords: Corporate Environmental Performance; Corporate Waste Management; Toxic Waste; Internal Control over Financial Reporting; Environmental Effects of Accounting
