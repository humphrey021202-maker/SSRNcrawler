Abstract

Does executive cash compensation in China's A-share listed companies truly correlate with reported accounting performance? While the prevailing literature suggests a resounding 'yes', our findings tell a different story: Executive pay-for-performance exists only in literature in China. By analyzing individual CEO time-series data from 2000 to 2019, we find little evidence to support a significant positive pay-for-performance relationship for A-share listed companies. This starkly contrasts with the positive, albeit small, pay-for-performance sensitivities (PPS) consistently reported in mainstream cross-sectional studies. Our results reveal that only 33 CEOs formally received economically meaningful PPS. However, due to their generally low level of cash compensation, even these CEOs experienced minimal pay increases despite improved firm performance. Similarly, their compensation remained relatively unchanged even when performance declined. This discrepancy highlights the need for a critical reassessment. Shareholders and regulators of A-share listed companies need to re-evaluate and potentially restructure managerial compensation incentive mechanisms, including both cash and equity-based incentives. Likewise, academia should critically reexamine the conclusions drawn from existing literature on this topic.

Keywords: executive incentives, cash pay, pay-for-performance sensitivity, tenure, managerial talent matching hypothesis
