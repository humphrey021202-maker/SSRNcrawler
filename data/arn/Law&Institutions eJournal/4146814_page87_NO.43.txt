Abstract

The goal of this study is to assess how well Indian power generation and transmission firms’ disclosure their exposure to weather risks in their annual reports. The analyses utilised the textual content analysis approach and hand-collected data from annual reports of firms. Ten power generating and transmission firms that are listed on the NSE are considered in the research. These firms' primary line of work is the production and distribution of electricity from various energy sources, including coal, biomass, wind, hydro, and biogas. For the study, the annual reports from 2010–11 to 2019–2020 were collected and analyzed. It is found that the majority of firms, including those that dealt with currencies, commodities, financial, and interest rates, reported using derivatives. No information is provided in the annual report about the management or reduction of weather-related risk, and no weather derivative methods or management techniques are employed.
