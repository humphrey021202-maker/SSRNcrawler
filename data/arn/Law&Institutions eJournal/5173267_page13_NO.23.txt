Abstract

We examine the effects of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) oversight on private fund advisers. We propose that SEC investigations could improve advisers’ disclosure and governance, facilitating advisers’ fundraising. However, private fund investors may view investigations as negative signals, reducing fundraising ability, or may focus on private communication with advisers or attributes other than disclosure and governance, suggesting no effect of SEC oversight on fundraising. Consistent with benefits from SEC oversight, fundraising increases for investigated advisers following SEC investigations. Consistent with our proposed mechanisms, investigated advisers’ governance over financial reporting and disclosure transparency both increase following investigations. Increases in fundraising concentrate in investigated advisers with improved disclosures. These results further concentrate in advisers that reduce their investors’ required minimum investment following investigations, suggesting that an expanding investor base also drives results. Altogether, our evidence suggests that SEC investigations of advisers improve information for investors and facilitate capital formation. Our study provides new insight for regulators as they increasingly focus on private markets and contributes to the longstanding debate over regulation in private markets, especially as they open to a broader set of investors.
