Abstract

Differentiation and cost leadership are two generic strategies that firms can employ to gain competitive advantages in the product market. In this study, we examine whether CEOs' prior work experience in marketing-related positions (marketing experience) affects their preference for differentiation. Constructing a measure of the differentiation strategy based on 10-K filings, we find that CEOs with marketing experience prioritize differentiation. This effect is stronger for firms managed by more powerful CEOs, headquartered in states with individualistic cultures, experiencing less earnings pressure, facing higher demand uncertainty, and encountering larger threat from substitute products. Further analyses show that, for firms prioritizing differentiation, CEOs' marketing experience enhances innovation, increases gross margin, and boosts long-term stock returns. Collectively, our findings suggest that marketing experience steers CEOs toward the differentiation strategy to gain competitive advantages by providing innovative products and services, which allow firms to charge price premiums and create long-term values for shareholders.

Keywords: CEO employment history, business strategy, differentiation, cost leadership, competitive advantage, innovation
