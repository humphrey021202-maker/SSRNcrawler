Abstract

Accounting rates of return (ARRs), like ROA or ROIC, have become one of the most adopted performance metrics in executive compensation. Unlike level-based metrics, executives can improve ARRs by either boosting earnings or reducing assets/investment. Our study reveals that firms that tie CEO pay to ARRs achieve significantly better accounting rates of return by shrinking the denominator, e.g., trimming fixed assets and cutting investments. These actions, however, do not improve asset efficiency and are followed by weaker sales growth. Firms seem to weigh the effort required to cut assets against improving earnings, opting for shrinking strategies when costs are lower.

Keywords: Accounting rate of return, Compensation incentives, Performance manipulation, Managerial myopia, Shrinking mechanisms

JEL Classification: J33; M12; M41; G34
