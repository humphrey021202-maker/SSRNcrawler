Abstract

This study examined the moderating effect of profitability on the relationship between firm attributes and sustainability disclosure among listed consumer goods companies in Nigeria. The study employed hierarchical multiple regression to evaluate the contribution of firm characteristics-specifically tangibility and corporate size-to sustainability disclosure, and how profitability influences this relationship. The first regression model revealed a negative but insignificant relationship between firm attributes and sustainability disclosure, indicating that larger and more asset-intensive firms do not necessarily engage more in sustainability practices. However, upon introducing profitability as a moderating variable, the interaction term yielded a significant positive effect (β = 0.7328946), suggesting that profitability significantly enhances the relationship between firm attributes and sustainability disclosure. The computed effect size (f² = 1.79532) further indicated a "very large" moderating influence, according to Sawilowsky's (2009) classification. This finding implies that profitability acts as a critical enabling factor that drives corporate engagement in sustainability initiatives. The study concludes that firms with higher profitability are more likely to disclose sustainability-related information. The study recommends that regulators, corporate boards, and stakeholders integrate profitability-driven incentives and standardized sustainability reporting frameworks to strengthen corporate transparency and accountability within Nigeria's consumer goods sector.
