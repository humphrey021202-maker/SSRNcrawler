Abstract

This study documents that financial innovation is associated with adverse operational risk externalities. Using supervisory data on operational losses from large U.S. bank holding companies (BHCs), we show that organizations with more financial patent innovation suffer higher operational losses per dollar of assets and more severe tail risk events. Matching estimations, instrumental variable regressions, and event studies around influential patents provide consistent evidence. There is significant heterogeneity in the effect across different innovation types and operational loss types. The result is more pronounced for BHCs with weaker risk management. Our findings have important implications for banking supervision and risk management in an environment of rapid technology adoption.

Keywords: Operational risk, operational losses, financial innovation, financial patents, financial technology, fintech, bank holding companies, banking sector
