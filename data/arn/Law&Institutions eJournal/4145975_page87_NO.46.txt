Abstract

We examine peer information externalities in management forecasting decisions. While prior research emphasizes the importance of a common information environment for intra-industry information transfers, we investigate whether information transfers from firm-competitive news (i.e., news that is good (bad) for the announcer and bad (good) for the focal firm) can prompt voluntary disclosure changes. We exploit plausibly exogenous variation in forecasting order among peers to examine how focal firms alter their forecasts after observing their prior disclosing peers’ forecast news. We find that when previously disclosing peers reveal firm-competitive news, focal firms respond by altering the characteristics of their management forecasts, but only if peers disclose news that has negative implications for the focal firm. Specifically, when peers previously disclose firm-competitive news that is good news for the disclosing firm and bad news for the focal firm, we find that later disclosing focal firms issue forecasts that are positively biased and less accurate. Focal firms’ optimistic forecast bias is greater when previously disclosing peers are market leaders and when focal firm forecasts are for longer horizons. Focal firm managers appear to later walk down their optimistic forecasts and suffer limited reputational consequences from being overly optimistic. Overall, our findings highlight the role of firm-competitive peer disclosures as a determinant of forward-looking disclosure.

Keywords: voluntary disclosure, management forecasts, peer effects, calendar rotation
