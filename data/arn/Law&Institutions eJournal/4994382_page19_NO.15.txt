Abstract

We investigate whether outside directors of breached firms experience labor market consequences in the form of lost board seats. Using a sample of 494 cybersecurity breaches, we find that director turnover is significantly higher at breached firms. Additionally, directors of breached firms are more likely to lose board positions at other, non-breached firms and to experience a net loss of board positions. Further, we show that labor market penalties are stronger for directors linked to more severe cybersecurity breaches. We find that the relation between breaches and turnover is greater for directors disclosed as having cybersecurity expertise. However, we find no evidence that audit committee members are more likely to be penalized, which may reflect disclosure constraints that limit market participants' ability to hold directors responsible. Collectively, our results highlight stakeholders' expectations for boards to effectively oversee cybersecurity risk, and directors' incentives to provide such oversight.

Keywords: board turnover, director labor market, cybersecurity, governance, risk oversight, Breaches
