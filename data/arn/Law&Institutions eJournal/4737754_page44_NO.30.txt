Social Efficiency of Entry Under Common Ownership

Abstract

It is commonly believed that common ownership deters entry by internalising market competition which warrants procompetitive entry regulations. Considering a successive oligopoly model under common ownership structure, we argue that this belief may not necessarily hold true. We show that if the downstream sector alone operates under common ownership, entry is always socially excessive. When only the upstream sector or both the upstream and downstream sectors operate under common ownership, entry can still be socially excessive depending on the degree of common ownership and the relative competitiveness of the downstream sector. Therefore, our findings provide a rationale for anticompetitive entry regulations.

Keywords: Common Ownership, Excess entry, Insufficient entry

JEL Classification: D43, L13, L22
