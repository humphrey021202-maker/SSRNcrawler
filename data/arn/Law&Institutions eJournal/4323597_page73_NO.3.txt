Abstract

Starting in 2014, Western countries imposed sanctions on Russia, creating barriers to foreign financing for Russian firms and generating a large exogenous shock to funding. In response, the Russian government promoted domestic debt markets to support corporate financing. We study how this shock affected financial reporting, and, in particular, conditional conservatism, which is expected to facilitate arm’s length debt financing. While there is prior evidence on how the entry of foreign investors affects financial reporting, there is no prior research on how financial reporting changes when foreign investment is either forbidden or discouraged. We show that affected Russian firms decreased their conditional conservatism after the sanctions, suggesting that institutional reforms to adopt Western style corporate governance were superficial. As many countries pursue similar reforms to transition from politically influenced, stakeholder-oriented financial systems to market-based, shareholder-focused models, our results offer insight into how such transitions unfold.
