Abstract

This paper examines whether corporate social responsibility (CSR) engagement can mitigate the negative impact of climate policy uncertainty (CPU) on financial performance. Using a sample of firms in the Standards & Poor 1500 index over the 2002-2021 period, we show that a higher CSR-engagement offsets the negative impact of CPU on firms’ market valuation. Specifically, firms which build reputation capital through environmental and social investments may protect their market value during the periods of high CPU. Our results are robust to different model specifications and probable endogeneity issues.

Keywords: Climate policy uncertainty, Corporate social responsibility, Firm Value
