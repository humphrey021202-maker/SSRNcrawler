Abstract

We exploit the U.S. Supreme Court decisions of Kokesh v. SEC (2017) and Lucia v. SEC (2018) as a unique identification strategy to investigate the perceived value of securities law enforcement. Both decisions were unanticipated legal changes that substantially weakened the SEC’s enforcement tools. Using an event study framework, we find a significantly negative market reaction to both the Kokesh and Lucia rulings, indicating shareholders view the weakening of SEC enforcement tools as value destroying for the average firm. Cross-sectional tests reveal that the negative market reaction is particularly severe for firms where misappropriation risks are more pronounced. Our findings contribute to the ongoing debate on the value and importance of public enforcement.

Keywords: SEC, securities law enforcement, regulation, governance
