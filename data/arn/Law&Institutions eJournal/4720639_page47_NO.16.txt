Abstract

Capital structure decisions differ across regular investments and investment spikes. We study the cost of funding channel by investigating how an easing in firms' external financing cost affects corporate investment. This paper employs ECB's corporate security purchase program as a quasi-natural experiment that reduces firms' bond funding costs. Using balance sheet information on non-financial firms in France, we find that firms increase maintenance investment to replace existing assets, instead of investing in new equipment to grow in scale. Our findings suggest that firms face non-convex costs of capital adjustments and do not smoothly adjust investment following a shock in the cost of capital.

Keywords: investment, bond issuance, monetary policy
