Abstract

Environmental regulations with long implementation periods can unintentionally accelerate fossil fuel extraction, resulting in lower prices, increased consumption, and social costs from earlier pollutant exposure—a phenomenon known as the Green Paradox. This paper identifies an additional mechanism, which I term the "depreciation channel": owners of long-lived assets facing early retirement intensify consumption of the affected fixed assets, further increasing near-term emissions. Leveraging a shock to legal procedure during the Clean Power Plan litigation, I combine satellite and administrative data with a novel method for detecting spatial spillovers, directly measuring the paradox's effect on emissions and the role of the depreciation channel. Power plants increased emissions by over 6.5%, causing annual losses exceeding $22 billion. After adjusting for the price channel, I find a 7.5% rise in inefficient out-of-merit generation, underscoring the role of depreciation incentives in reinforcing the Green Paradox. Lastly, I offer a potential solution: government-owned power plants are largely unaffected by the paradox, suggesting scope for public-private bargaining between regulators and plant owners.
