Abstract

We report that US fintech firms have smaller cash holdings, and this phenomenon is irrelevant to firm-level political risk. Fintech firms have a higher level of political risk than other firms, but their cash management does not follow the generally known positive relationship between political risk and cash holdings. Fintech firms’ cash management is not consistent with the negative association between firm age and cash holdings.

Keywords: Fintech, Political risk, Cash holdings
