Abstract

This article presents an empirical study on the impact of institutional investors' shareholding on the level of corporate digital transformation based on sample data from Chinese A-share listed companies from 2016 to 2020. The research findings indicate a significant inhibitory effect of institutional investors' shareholding on corporate digital transformation. In comparison to pressure-resistant institutional investors, pressure-sensitive institutional investors exhibit a stronger inhibitory effect on corporate digital transformation. Furthermore, short-term holding institutional investors display a more pronounced inhibitory effect on corporate digital transformation when contrasted with long-term holding institutional investors. Notably, there is no difference between high-shareholding and low-shareholding institutional investors.

Keywords: Corporate Digital Transformation, Corporate Strategy, Digital Economy, Institutional Investors
