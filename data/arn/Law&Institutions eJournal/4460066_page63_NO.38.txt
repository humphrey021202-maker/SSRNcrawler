Abstract

This study examines how foreign competition influences firms’ external growth strategies. Exploiting staggered U.S. import tariff reductions as a quasi-natural experiment, we find that heightened competition drives firms’ preferences toward forming strategic alliances. This shift is more pronounced for firms with limited financial or operational flexibility, weaker competitive positions, and those operating in low-entry-barrier industries. Under competitive pressure, firms preferentially form alliances with partners in the same industry as well as in high-tech, business-to-consumer (B2C), and product-differentiated sectors. In the long term, alliance-focused firms exhibit higher R&D intensity and patent outputs. Overall, the study highlights how domestic firms reshape external growth choices, partner selection, and long-term innovation outcomes in response to global competition shocks.
