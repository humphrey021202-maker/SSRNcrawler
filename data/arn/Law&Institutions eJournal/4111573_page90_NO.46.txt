Abstract

Using a dataset created through textual analysis and manual collection, we show that, prior to the adoption of ASC 606: (1) firms with principal-vs-agent (PA) exposure faced heightened GAAP compliance risk and (2) their investors incurred higher revenue information processing costs. We consider two potential channels for these effects: GAAP complexity and managerial incentives. The evidence generally supports the GAAP complexity channel. Following ASC 606 adoption, compliance risk declined among PA firms. However, investor information processing costs remained elevated and, in some cases, increased. The overall evidence is consistent with the continued use of both gross and net reporting of revenues under ASC 606 increasing the costs associated with integrating revenue information, particularly for agents and mixed firms. Standard setters might consider additional disclosure requirements to improve transparency about the nature of PA transactions and enable investors to better estimate, reconcile, and interpret net and gross revenues.

Keywords: revenue recognition, principal-versus-agent considerations, ASC 606, compliance risk, information processing

JEL Classification: L86, M41, M42, M48
