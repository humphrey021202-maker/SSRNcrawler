Abstract

We use Say Tech-an online platform where companies solicit and answer questions from retail investors-as a laboratory to study retail-investor-driven changes in disclosure and their consequences. We find that firms are more likely to use the platform when their retail ownership and Seeking Alpha coverage are greater. When firms use the platform, retail investor trade informativeness and user requests for 10-K/Q filings increase relative to a matched control sample. Focusing on firms that use the platform around earnings announcements, we find that managers answer 4.5 retail investor questions and 3.2 fewer analyst questions during regular earnings calls, suggesting increased attention to retail investors is accompanied by reduced attention to analysts. Finally, retail investors' questions are no less sophisticated but seek different information than analysts' questions. We conclude that retail investors have different information needs and that catering to these needs can spur retail investors' information production.
