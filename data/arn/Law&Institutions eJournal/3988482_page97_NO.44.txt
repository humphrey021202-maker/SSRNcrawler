Abstract

Using staggered release of real-time satellite data on retail firms’ parking lot traffic as a quasi-natural experiment, we find that retailers significantly increase dividend payouts after their satellite data is made available to investors. This dividend increase is more pronounced for firms with limited growth opportunities or poor corporate governance. Retailers finance this dividend increase by decreasing asset growth and executive compensation, while maintaining R&D investment and external financing. Our findings support the outcome model of dividend and demonstrate that alternative data can effectively bridge the information gap between managers and external investors, thus serving as an effective governance mechanism.

Keywords: Alternative Data; Satellite Imagery Data; Dividend Policy; Agency Theory; Corporate Governance

JEL Classification: G31, G32, G34, G35
