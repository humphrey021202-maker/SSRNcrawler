Abstract

We use a shock to the enforcement of fair lending laws - the 2017 change in U.S. political leadership, which led to an immediate 99% drop in Department of Justice fair lending enforcement - to measure bank lending discrimination. Using a differences-in-differences design, we distinguish discriminatory behavior from other potential explanations for interest rate disparities. We find that when enforcement is relaxed, banks charge higher interest rate spreads to Black or Hispanic borrowers and borrowers in lower- and middle-income areas. This effect is more significant for large banks and banks reprimanded previously. Competition mitigates the increase, but bank environmental, social, and governance (ESG) commitments do not. Results are not driven by systematic changes in application rates, borrower creditworthiness, or loan quality. Results are robust to subsample analyses using matched borrower credit scores from Experian and Fannie Mae data. We also document that increased enforcement during the previous administration led to lower interest rate spreads for Black or Hispanic borrowers.

Keywords: Banks, Corporate social responsibility (CSR), Fair lending, Credit access, Enforcement, Environmental social governance (ESG)
