Abstract

This paper examines how improvement in corporate governance shapes a firm's capital structure and leverage dynamics. Using a non-standard implementation of a globally prescribed governance reform-mandating the formation of an audit committee-for large OTC firms in India, the paper shows that governance reforms make firms stable as capital structure tilts towards equity: leverage declines and paid-up capital increases. Better-governed firms strategically lower leverage by reducing borrowing from capital-constrained bankers while partially offsetting this by borrowing from financially stable banks. Furthermore, financial flexibility considerations shape capital structure as new debt is cheaper, sourced from wellcapitalized banks, and investment-linked. Finally, the reform has value-enhancing implications as firms grow and investment selection improves.

Keywords: Firm Corporate Governance, Capital Structure, Financial Flexibility, Bank Capital, Agency cost
