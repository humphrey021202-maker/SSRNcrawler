Abstract

Malaysia stands at the edge of a major digital transformation in tax administration with the scheduled implementation of mandatory electronic invoicing (E-Invoicing) starting in August 2024. Positioned as a cornerstone of the nation's broader digitalization efforts, e-invoicing is expected to reshape business transaction processes by promoting greater transparency, operational efficiency, and improved tax compliance. However, the transition poses significant challenges, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which often lack the necessary infrastructure and readiness in implementing e-invoicing. This study investigates the diverse dimensions of e-invoicing adoption in Malaysia, emphasizing its potential benefits, regulatory hurdles, and implementation barriers. Drawing from extensive literature, the research highlights major concerns such as limited digital capabilities, integration difficulties with existing systems, and rising cybersecurity risks. Despite clear advantages including cost savings, improved data accuracy, and environmental benefits measures the success of this initiative depends heavily on well-structured policies, resilient digital infrastructure, and the integration of technologies like blockchain, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing. The study underscores the importance of targeted support, clear regulatory guidance, and capacity in the building programs to ensure inclusive and effective adoption across all business segments.

Keywords: Digital Readiness, E-invoicing, Tax Reform
