Abstract

I examine how exposure to disengaged retail voters influences firms’ corporate governance activities. I define this exposure as the extent to which unvoted retail investor shares reduce the proportion of shares represented at shareholder meetings. My analyses leverage decisions by Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade to discontinue voting on routine proposals on behalf of retail investors who do not submit voting instructions. These discontinuations significantly increase firms’ exposure to disengaged retail voters, with the most affected firms experiencing a 10.1% decline in the proportion of shares represented at shareholder meetings, making it more difficult to achieve quorum and pass stock-related routine proposals. Firms respond by enhancing retail investor engagement efforts through reducing processing costs associated with voting. While these efforts are effective in increasing participation, they also result in reduced support for management recommendations. Some firms mitigate the need for such efforts by lowering quorum requirements, which may weaken governance by increasing management control over shareholder voting outcomes. The decision to lower quorum thresholds appears to be influenced by cost considerations and firms’ attempts to address shareholder opposition and participation risk. Collectively, my findings shed light on the challenges and costs associated with firm exposure to disengaged retail voters, an increasingly important but previously unexplored aspect of the proxy voting system.

Keywords: Corporate Governance, Retail Investors, Shareholder Voting, Proxy Solicitation
