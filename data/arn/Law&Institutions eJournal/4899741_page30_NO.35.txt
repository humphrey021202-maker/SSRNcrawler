Abstract

The adoption of the Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL) model, a new methodology for accounting for expected credit losses, has significantly increased bank earnings volatility. Using a difference-in-differences design around adoption, we examine how more volatile earnings impact CEO compensation design. We find that post-CECL, bank CEO pay becomes less sensitive to earnings, but more sensitive to other performance measures, such as stock returns and revenues. Additionally, total executive compensation increases, consistent with the higher risk premia demanded by bank executives. Overall, our results suggest that compensation committees view accounting earnings as having lower contractual usefulness for incentives after CECL.

Keywords: Pay-Performance Sensitivity, Earnings-Based Incentive Compensation, CECL
