Abstract

This research investigates the impact of audit committee attributes on the financial reporting quality of listed consumer goods firms in Nigeria. The study examines specific characteristics such as the size, independence, expertise, and meeting frequency of audit committees and their influence on financial reports' accuracy, reliability, and transparency. The study employs an ex-post facto research design, focusing on consumer goods companies listed on the Nigerian Exchange from 2014 to 2023, utilizing a population size of 21 consumer goods firms listed on the Nigerian Exchange, and a sample size of 12. The study employs quantitative methods to analyze the relationship between these attributes and financial reporting quality. The findings provide insights into how audit committee attributes can enhance corporate governance and improve financial disclosures, ultimately benefiting investors, regulators, and other stakeholders. The study concludes that audit committee size, independence, and meetings influence financial performance. The study recommends that companies ensure diverse and competent audit committee attributes to improve financial performance.
