Abstract

This study investigates how firms use product quality to repair reputational damage following financial misconduct announcements. Using consumer ratings from a major online retail platform and a difference-in-differences design, we find that firms involved in fraudulent activities significantly enhance product quality after their misconduct is exposed. These improvements are concentrated in products with high visibility and extensive media coverage, where reputational returns are greatest. We also provide direct evidence that consumers react negatively to misconduct announcements, creating strong incentives for firms to improve quality. Moreover, these quality enhancements prove effective in restoring consumer trust: sales recover within a few years, primarily among fraudulent firms that improve quality. Overall, our findings highlight an important, socially beneficial, yet unintended consequence of fraud revelations and identify product quality enhancement as a distinct mechanism of reputation repair.

Keywords: Financial Misconduct, Product Quality, Consumer Satisfaction, Reputation Rebuild

JEL Classification: M41, M11, G30
