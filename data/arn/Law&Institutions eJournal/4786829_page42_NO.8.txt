Abstract

We document the spillover disciplining effects of the green credit on corporate misconduct in addition to environmental violations. Exploiting the staggered green finance reform in China as a quasi-natural experiment, we find that pilot firms exhibit both less probability and frequency of financial misconduct after the green finance reform. We identify multiple economic mechanisms for this causal relationship. First, green credit improves internal governance by decreasing insider stock pledges, real earnings management, and related party transactions. Moreover, green credit results in increased external monitoring from institutional visits, analyst coverage, and media attention. Furthermore, we find that the disciplining effects are more pronounced for firms owned by the state, for firms in highly concentrated industries, and for firms with lower participation of independent directors and higher ownership concentration. Overall, our findings highlight that unique screening and oversight mechanisms associated with green credit could have positive spillovers on general credit governance, and assessing environmental initiatives can further provide visibility into overall accountability, controls, and reporting quality.

Keywords: Corporate Misconduct, business ethics, Green Credit, Market Discipline, green finance
