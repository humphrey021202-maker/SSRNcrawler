Abstract

We investigate the impact of capital market pressure to deliver short-term financial performance on product safety. We find that firms that face heightened pressure exhibit a higher frequency of product recalls. They also experience more customer reports of safety incidents, injuries, and property damages before the recalls. These safety hazards are more severe. These firms are more likely to issue refunds, a costly option to handle recalls, suggesting product safety issues beyond repairs. Further, attracting long-term institutional shareholders, maintaining board independence, and implementing robust internal controls mitigate the deleterious effects of financial performance pressure on product safety. Overall, our findings underscore how pursuing short-term financial goals may lead to myopic behavior and divert attention from crucial operational aspects, leading to compromised product quality and subsequent safety issues necessitating recalls.

Keywords: financial pressure, product quality, product safety

JEL Classification: M1
