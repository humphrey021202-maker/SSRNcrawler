Abstract

Critics claim that the compensation consultants help inflate CEO pay in order to gain future business and to cross-sell additional services. We investigate whether compensation consultants’ expected fee growth in the subsequent year is associated with the magnitude of CEO pay before and after the SEC passed new rules on the usage of compensation consultants in 2012 (SEC 2012). Using a sample of companies from S&P 1500 firms, we first examine this association based on compensation consultants’ expected fee growth in fiscal years 2013 and 2014, respectively, and the difference in this association between these two years. We find that total CEO pay is negatively associated with both consultants’ expected compensation consulting (CC) fee growth and total fee growth, respectively, in 2013, but these associations are significantly positive in 2014; the differences in these associations between 2014 and 2013 are significant. Total CEO pay decreases with consultants’ expected non-compensation consulting (NCC) fee growth in 2013, but is not associated with consultants’ expected NCC fee growth in 2014; the difference between 2014 and 2013 is not significant. Moreover, we find that in clients with high-fee-growth opportunities, compensation consultants’ expected maximum change in any single fee category (e.g., CC fees, NCC fees, and total fees) is associated with lower total CEO pay in 2013, but this association is not significant in 2014; the difference between 2014 and 2013 is significant. We find that the association between total CEO pay and consultants’ expected CC fee growth as well as expected NCC fee growth, respectively, is more negative after (i.e. 2013) than before (i.e. 2010) the SEC (2012) rules. Hence, our results suggest that in 2013 the constraining effect of the SEC (2012) rules dominates the financial incentives effect, but this relation is reversed in 2014. The SEC (2012) rules constrain consultants’ financial incentives to grow the future business by recommending higher CEO pay, but the effect is mainly in 2013.
