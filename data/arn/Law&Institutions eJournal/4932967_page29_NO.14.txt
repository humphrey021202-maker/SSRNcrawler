Abstract

We construct a measure of systemic risk, DRSFIN, that combines the high frequency information available in equity returns with a simple structural model of default. DRSFIN predicts future bank failures even after controlling for bank characteristics, macroeconomic conditions, uncertainty, and existing measures of aggregate systemic risk. We then show that DRSFIN is able to predict aggregate loan growth and nonfinancial firm failure, indicating that it not only predicts disruption in the financial sector, but also has real effects. Finally, we show that DRSFIN is also associated with elevated market uncertainty and stress in international markets.


Keywords: Systemic risk, financial institutions, distance-to-default, value-at-risk

In each regression, controls for general macroeconomic conditions are used (though not reported to save space), as defined in Table 1. Predictors are lagged by j months, where j = {1, 3, 6, 12}. They are normalized to have zero mean and unit variance. t-statistics are reported in parentheses using standard errors that are corrected for autocorrelation using Newey-West Posted: 1987
