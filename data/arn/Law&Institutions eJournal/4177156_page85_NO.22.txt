Abstract

Our paper shows that passive ownership improves accounting conservatism by exploiting the Bank of Japan’s (BOJ’s) equity exchange-traded funds (ETFs) purchasing program as a source of exogenous variation of passive ownership among Japanese listed companies. We find that a positive association exists between passive ownership and accounting conservatism. We also use the revised Japanese Stewardship Code adopted in 2017 to examine whether monitoring intensity changes this relationship. The revised Code forced institutional investors to disclose the results of voting at all shareholder meetings, which could improve institutional investors’ monitoring intensity. We find that the positive sensitivity is higher in a subsample after 2017. These findings demonstrate that monetary policy indirectly affects the corporate governance of listed firms.

Keywords: Passive ownership; Accounting conservatism; Unconventional monetary policy; Exchange-traded funds (ETFs); Bank of Japan (BOJ)

JEL Classification: G28, G30, M41, M48
