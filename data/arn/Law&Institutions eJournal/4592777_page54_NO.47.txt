Two Birds, One Stone: Board Diversity Helps Improve Firm Sustainability

Abstract

I use a mixed methods approach to examine the relationship between corporate board diversity and ESG outcomes in the United States. Boards of directors have come under increased scrutiny as federal regulators and the general public better grasp their central role in business decision-making. It is against this heightened awareness that I examine ESG, a particularly fraught topic with far-reaching consequences for the future of climate change. My empirical results indicate that firms with diverse boards of directors have stronger ESG ratings. These results are validated qualitatively through several interviews with industry experts. Overall, my findings suggest that legislation aimed at improving board diversity may also implicitly aid in environmental regulation of the private sector.

Keywords: corporate governance, ESG, diversity, board of directors
