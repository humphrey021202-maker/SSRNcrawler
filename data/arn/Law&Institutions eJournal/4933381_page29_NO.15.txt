Abstract

This study explores how heightened minority shareholder protections by the China Securities Investor Services Center (CSISC) impacts firms’ earnings management strategies in China’s corporate environment, where the primary agency issue involves controlling shareholders expropriating minority investors. While extant literature largely portrays the CSISC program as an effective governance mechanism that enhances financial reporting quality and mitigates risks, our study offers a more nuanced perspective. Building upon prior evidence that CSISC curbs accrual-based earnings management, we demonstrate that firms may respond to this increased monitoring by shifting towards alternative, less scrutinized earnings manipulation techniques—real transactions management. Our findings suggest that this substitution effect is particularly pronounced when firms face stronger incentives for earnings manipulation, attract institutional investors with shorter investment horizons, operate in environments with lower real earnings management costs, or have CEOs with significant reputational concerns. In contrast to the prevailing narrative that primarily underscores CSISC’s positive impacts, our study reveals a more complex dynamic, wherein regulatory interventions aimed at protecting minority shareholder interests may inadvertently prompt firms to adopt potentially value-damaging real activities manipulation.

Keywords: minority shareholder protection, accrual-based earnings management, real earnings management
