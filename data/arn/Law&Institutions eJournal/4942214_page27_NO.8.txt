Abstract

We study auditors' client risk management with regard to firm-level political risk. While prior research relies mainly on economy-wide proxies for political risk, Hanssan, Hollander, van Lent, and Taboun (2019) suggest that a substantial part of political risk plays out at the firm level. Using a new measure of firm-level political risk, we find that higher political-risk firms are charged with higher audit fees and associated with longer audit report delay. Higher political-risk firms are also more likely to receive going concern opinions. However, we do not find that auditors are more likely to resign from higher political-risk firms. We contribute to the auditing literature by studying previously unexamined firm-level political risk and demonstrating that it affects auditor decisions. Our findings have significant implications for accounting firms, regulators, and managers and directors (especially audit committee members) of public companies.

Keywords: political risk, client risk management, audit fee, audit effort, going concern
