Abstract

Operational risk management is a critical component of financial stability, particularly in Islamic financial institutions (IFIs), which must navigate both global regulatory standards such as Basel III and local regulatory mandates such as ORR (Operational Risk Reporting) and IFSA 2013. This study explores the regulatory landscape governing operational risk, with a particular focus on the transition from ORION to ORR, highlighting enhancements in fraud detection, cybersecurity risk monitoring, and Shariah non-compliance governance. A key issue in Basel III is its emphasis on capital adequacy for operational risk, mandating financial institutions to allocate capital based on the Standardized Approach for Operational Risk (SA-OR). However, Basel III does not explicitly address Shariah governance risks, creating a regulatory gap for IFIs that must manage both financial and Shariah compliance risks. By contrast, Malaysia’s ORR framework mandates real-time operational risk disclosures, covering a broader scope of fraud, IT security threats, and governance risks, but does not impose direct capital requirements as Basel III does. The study identifies key challenges in integrating Basel III’s capital adequacy approach with ORR’s risk disclosure-based framework, particularly for IFIs that must comply with Shariah risk governance standards under SGPD 2019. The lack of standardization in Shariah non-compliance risk reporting, inconsistent enforcement of fraud detection mechanisms, and gaps in cybersecurity risk monitoring create challenges in harmonizing both frameworks. To address these gaps, this study proposes a dual compliance framework that aligns Basel III’s capital risk measures with ORR’s real-time operational risk disclosures, ensuring regulatory transparency, investor confidence, and financial resilience in Islamic banking.
