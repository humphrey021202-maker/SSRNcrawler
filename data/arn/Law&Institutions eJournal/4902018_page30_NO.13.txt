Abstract

We examine whether employee stock option exercise decisions are driven by diversification concerns. Using data for 3,500 employees across five companies, we show that changes in home prices, our proxy for exogenous changes in outside wealth, are positively associated with option exercises. We also find that exercise is more likely following new grants of restricted stock but not new grants of options, implied risk-aversion parameters assuming a diversification motive are implausibly large, and employees often exercise all exercisable options at the same time. Collectively, our findings suggest that employees exercise options for consumption rather than diversification purposes.

Keywords: Employee stock options, stock-option exercise

Declaration of Interest

We have received in-kind support in the form of access to data from a stock plan administration firm. The terms of the non-disclosure agreement in connection with receiving access to this data preclude disclosing the name of the firm. Other than receiving the data, we do not have any formal relationship with the company, nor do we receive any financial support from the company.
