Abstract

Using Japan’s institutional background, this study examines the effects of increased reporting frequency on corporate capital finance. Prior studies found that frequent financial reporting decreases capital market frictions and changes corporate investment behavior. However, the connection between these two finding remains unclear. Specifically, it is not yet determined how the reduction in market frictions attributable to more frequent reporting affects corporate financing decisions. Using a difference-in-difference approach, this study shows that more frequent reporting increases external financing but not bank loans. Moreover, the study finds that increased reporting frequency has a stronger positive effect on firms with financial constraints, ex-ante information asymmetry, and greater external capital demand. Furthermore, this study examines how firms use the raised capital and finds that they do not change their capital structure or cash holding intensity but invest more. These findings suggest that increased reporting frequency enhances firm activities by mitigating asymmetric information.

Keywords: financial reporting frequency, quarterly reporting, quasi-private firms
