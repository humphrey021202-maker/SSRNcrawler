Abstract

This study examines the nexus between firm hedging strategies and corporate social responsibility (CSR). Utilizing textual analysis of 10-K filings to measure corporate hedging, we find that firms with higher levels of CSR are more inclined to engage in hedging practices and with greater intensity. This tendency is further amplified in the presence of strong corporate governance frameworks. We posit that this behavior is primarily driven by the mitigation of cash flow volatility, the cost of equity, and the cost of debt. Our analysis includes various endogeneity tests, such as entropy balancing and an instrumental variables approach that considers political and geographic factors. The robustness of the results is further validated using alternative CSR and hedging metrics. This study contributes to the growing body of literature on the strategic financial implications of CSR, highlighting its complementary role in corporate risk management.
