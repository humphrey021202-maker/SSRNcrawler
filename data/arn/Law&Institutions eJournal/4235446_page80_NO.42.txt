Abstract

We hypothesize that when managers do not exercise their options, they signal valuable private information. Accordingly, we construct a proxy to capture managers’ private information from their in-the-money vested options unexercised (VOU) and find a positive relation with subsequent operating performance. Firms with higher VOU also receive more favorable analyst recommendations and upgraded credit ratings. Firms with higher VOUs are more likely to issue news releases, share repurchases, and stock splits to convey that private information to the public. High VOU firms’ stocks are also underpriced; a long-short portfolio based on VOU generates a 5% alpha annually.

Keywords: private information, vested options, in-the-money, operating performance, stock underpricing, alpha

JEL Classification: G11, G14, G32, G35, G40
