Abstract

This study focuses on U.S. shareholder derivative cases in which Audit Committee members were defendants. Three grounds for Audit Committee liability were alleged in those cases: (1) violation of the Fiduciary Duties of Care, Loyalty or Good Faith, which may include failure to provide proper oversight; (2) violation of the Securities Exchange Act (SEA) by issuing an untrue statement regarding the sale of a security; and (3) violation of the SEA because Audit Committee members may be considered to be control persons.

Keywords: audit committee, legal liability, corporation, shareholder derivative case, litigation, fiduciary duties, Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Securities Exchange Act, control person, oversight
