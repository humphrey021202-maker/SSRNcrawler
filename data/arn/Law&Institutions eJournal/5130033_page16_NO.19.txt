Abstract

One in four external CEO successors is connected to the hiring firm's outside directors-a much higher frequency than expected. Connected hirings are particularly pronounced among informationally opaque firms and less established CEOs. Consistent with rent sharing, connected CEOs enhance firm value relative to unconnected CEOs, and they receive lower initial compensation, although the pay differential subsequently dissipates. Finally, the firm-CEO matching quality of connected CEOs is comparable to that of unconnected CEOs as both display similar separation rates. Overall, our findings suggest that connected hirings alleviate bilateral information asymmetry in the CEO labor market, leading to better firm-CEO matches. 

Keywords: CEO labor market, CEO-firm matching, External CEO succession, Social network, CEO compensation

JEL Classification: G30, G34
