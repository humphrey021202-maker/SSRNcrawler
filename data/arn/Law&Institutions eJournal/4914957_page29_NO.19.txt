Abstract

This study aims to measure the financial performance of the company through financial ratio analysis. The financial ratios used are liquidity ratios, activity ratios, solvency ratios, and profitability ratios. Despite a stable increase in receivables turnover activity, the liquidity ratio remains below industry standards. Additionally, although solvency is relatively stable, the company needs to manage its capital structure to avoid unwanted financial risks. Nonetheless, the company overall still shows reasonable profitability, providing a positive outlook for shareholders.
