Abstract

We provide new, nuanced evidence on the evolution of individual director influence, measured as idiosyncratic return correlations between firms sharing a director. New directors with similar experience to the incumbent board gain influence quickly, while directors with greater initial influence tend to take a "quiet life" approach later. Once influence declines substantially, directors tend to depart. Rising influence is rewarded by the labor market with additional and more prestigious directorships and is valued by the stock market reaction at appointments and departures. We address potential endogeneity with high-dimensional fixed effects in diff-in-diff regressions and director deaths as exogenous shocks.

Keywords: Director influence, Director tenure, Stock return co-movement, Director turnover. JEL Classification: G34

JEL Classification: G34
