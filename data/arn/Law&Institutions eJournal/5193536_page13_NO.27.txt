Abstract

This study explores the influence of social credit improvement on high abnormal audit fees, based on China's social credit system pilot policy. Using data from China’s A-share listed companies from 2008 to 2023, this paper demonstrates that the improved social credit reduces high abnormal audit fees by mitigating litigation risks, enhancing audit efficiency, and curbing audit opinion shopping. The reduction effect is more pronounced in non-state-owned enterprises and firms with shorter audit tenures. This social credit-induced reduction in abnormal audit fees is associated with measurable improvements in audit quality, suggesting that the policy generates positive externalities in financial reporting oversight.

Keywords: China's social credit system pilot policy, High abnormal audit fees, Audit quality
