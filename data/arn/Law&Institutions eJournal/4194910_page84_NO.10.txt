What is Stock Market Short-Termism?

Abstract

What precisely is stock market short-termism? For an issue that pervades corporate governance thinking, rhetoric, and policymaking, one would think that we know well what it is. But much that’s called stock market short-termism is not properly categorized as such. This distinction—between true stock-market short-termism and false short-termism—is the focus of this article.

Keywords: Short-termism, quarterly capitalism, hedge funds, shareholder activism, R&D, capex, investment, buybacks

JEL Classification: D72, E71, G18, G34, G38, G41, K22, L21
