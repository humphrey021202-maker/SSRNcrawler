Abstract

This study investigates the effect of board composition on dividend policy decisions in 153 publicly listed firms, focusing on how characteristics such as gender diversity, independence, and board size influence corporate dividend payout practices. The purpose is to provide empirical insights into the governance mechanisms impacting dividend policies, which play a critical role in shareholder value and corporate financial strategy. Covering a period from 2014 to 2023, this study examines a panel dataset of publicly traded companies from multiple industries, using random effects regression analysis to assess the relationship between various board attributes and dividend payout ratios. Findings reveal that board independence and gender diversity are positively associated with higher dividend payouts, suggesting that independent and gender-diverse boards may favour consistent return policies to enhance shareholder value. Conversely, larger board sizes are associated with lower dividend payouts, likely due to increased oversight and conservative financial practices. This study is among the first to offer comprehensive empirical evidence on the role of board composition in shaping dividend decisions within an emerging market context. The originality of this research lies in its detailed focus on the specific attributes of board composition and their nuanced effects on dividend policy, contributing to the understanding of governance factors driving financial decisions in diverse corporate settings.

Keywords: board gender diversity, board independence, board size, dividend policy decision
