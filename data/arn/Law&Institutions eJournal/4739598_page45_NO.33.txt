Abstract

This study examines the influence of female directors on the performance of publicly listed Taiwanese companies amid challenging operational conditions. Employing the Difference-in-Differences (DiD) methodology, the research tackles potential endogeneity concerns by capitalizing on an exogenous shock—specifically, the Taiwan Stock Exchange’s 2015 integration of female directors into corporate governance evaluation criteria. Analyzing data spanning from 2002 to 2020, the study focuses on market and accounting performance metrics, including stock return, industry-adjusted return, return on assets (ROA), and return on equity (ROE). Various female director variables, such as count and proportion, are scrutinized, alongside binary indicators assessing critical mass representation. The research categorizes companies into high and low operational risk, utilizing a DiD regression model to explore the impact of female director appointments on firm value and performance. The findings highlight that, especially in high-risk firms, appointing female directors positively influences stock return, providing valuable insights into the nuanced role of gender diversity in demanding business environments.

Keywords: Gender Diversity, Female directors, Corporate governance evaluation, Difference-in-Differences (DiD) methodology, Firm Performance
