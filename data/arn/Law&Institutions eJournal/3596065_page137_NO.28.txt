Abstract

Firms routinely manage their financial reporting systems on external cloud platforms that are susceptible to cyberattacks and data integrity issues. Therefore, the AICPA developed a special type of voluntary audit called a "Service Organization Control" audit (SOC audit) that evaluates this risk. This study conducts one of the first systematic analyses of the benefits and costs of these voluntary audits. Using hand-collected data from public firms, I find that (1) 29 percent of firms in the S&P 500 (representing $10.9 trillion in market value) receive these audits; (2) business-model exposure to technology predicts a firm's decision to receive these audits; (3) the scope of these audits includes internal controls over data integrity; and (4) these audits are one of the largest predictors of the variation in audit-related fees, amounting to a $900,000 average annual increase in these fees at the firm level (by comparison, tax preparation fees average about $1.3 million). SOC audits are thus an important and concrete example of the broader social and governance mandates of new stakeholder-focused reporting frameworks, such as the SASB's Conceptual Framework.
