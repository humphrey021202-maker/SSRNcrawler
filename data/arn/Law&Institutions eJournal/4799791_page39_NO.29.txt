Abstract

This paper offers a comprehensive analysis of earnings management, synthesizing insights from the 100 most cited studies in this significant field of accounting research. Utilizing a robust methodology, we sourced citation counts as of January 1, 2024, from two leading academic databases: Web of Science and Google Scholar. This approach allowed for the identification and examination of pivotal works that have shaped understanding and discussions in the realm of earnings management. The range of citations for these influential studies is remarkable, reflecting their impact and importance in the academic community. The most cited paper in our analysis boasts a staggering 14,571 citations, indicating its central role in shaping the discourse around earnings management. Conversely, the least cited paper, with 599 citations, still contributes substantially to the field, underlining the depth and diversity of research in this area.Our analysis delves into various themes that emerge from these landmark studies, including the impact of corporate governance on earnings management practices, the influence of global and cultural variations, the role of audit quality, the complex interplay of managerial incentives, market reactions, regulatory changes, and the dichotomy between accrual-based and real earnings management. This thematic exploration not only highlights the nuanced and multifaceted nature of earnings management but also sheds light on the evolving methodologies and analytical approaches adopted by researchers over time.The findings from this synthesis offer critical insights into the mechanics of earnings management, its underlying motivations, and the broad spectrum of strategies employed by firms in different contexts. This paper contributes to the academic literature by providing a consolidated view of the most influential research in earnings management, drawing connections between various studies, and highlighting areas for future research. Our work serves as a valuable resource for academics, practitioners, and policymakers, offering a thorough understanding of the complexities and implications of earnings management in the contemporary financial reporting landscape.
