Abstract

Earnings management represents a fundamental concern in financial markets. Although misreporting clearly requires collusion and/or complicity from accounting staff, no prior archival paper examines how individuals predisposed to manage earnings are attracted and placed into accounting positions. Using a Large Language Model (LLM), we train Google BERT to classify accounting job posting language as representing either “rule-bender,” “rule-follower,” or “neutral” job demands, and find that rule-bender language in quarterly job postings predicts accruals earnings management and meet/beat behavior in firms. In cross-sectional tests of costs/benefits to earnings manipulation, rule-bending language differentially predicts both accruals and real earnings management. Our results do not merely reflect firm culture or a general propensity to bend rules across domains, as rule-bending language in salesperson and scientist job postings does not predict earnings management. Collectively, we find that firms appear to strategically utilize rule-bending language in accounting job postings to attract rule-bending personnel.
