Abstract

I examine whether and how the increased availability of bank loans affects borrowers’ voluntary disclosures. To do so, I exploit the staggered deregulation of interstate bank branching across the U.S. I find that an exogenous increase in credit supply following bank branching deregulation leads to a decrease in voluntary disclosure of firms that rely on bank loans as their main source of external financing (i.e., bank-dependent firms). I further examine how increased credit supply alters the voluntary disclosure cost-benefit tradeoff of bank-dependent firms. I find that the decrease in voluntary disclosures is (i) muted for firms with higher information asymmetry and higher litigation risk; and (ii) exacerbated among borrowers with higher proprietary information costs and stronger lending relationships. Further, firms that decrease their voluntary disclosures experience reduced stock market liquidity. Taken together, my study sheds light on how regulatory changes in the banking sector have externalities on borrowers’ disclosure decisions.
