Abstract

The last decade has witnessed a boom in studies examining auditing at the partner level. This research is timely because audit partners’ names in the United States will be publicly disclosed starting in 2017. This paper reviews the existing literature on audit partners, discusses some concerns with certain aspects of the literature, and provides some suggestions for future research.

Keywords: Audit partners
