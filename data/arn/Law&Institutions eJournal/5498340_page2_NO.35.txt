Abstract

Tax enforcement affects corporate tax planning and firms’ information environments, but the internal organizational mechanisms behind these effects are not well understood. This study investigates one such mechanism: whether IRS audits lead firms to invest in accounting-related human capital. Using employment data from Revelio Labs, we document an average hiring response of approximately three additional accountants (a five percent increase) around IRS audits. Firms hire tax accountants when they rely less on external advisors, as well as when tax savings are at greater risk. General accountants are hired to meet the information demands imposed by IRS audits. Path analysis reveals that these hiring responses mitigate IRS audit-induced increases in cash effective tax rates, with each additional accountant associated with approximately $950K in tax savings over three years among profitable firms. We further find that this accounting labor investment partially explains improvements in firms’ information environments documented in prior research. By identifying accounting labor investment as a channel through which IRS audits affect firms, we extend prior research on the effects of tax enforcement. We also highlight a long-term compliance cost of tax enforcement, which is particularly salient in light of well-documented shortages of accounting talent.

Keywords: Tax audits, tax personnel, accounting personnel, tax planning, cost of capital
