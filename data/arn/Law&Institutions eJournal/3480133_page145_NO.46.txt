Abstract

This paper is the first to systematically examine whether accretive share repurchases serve as a substitute for other earnings management tools in a recursive context. Employing a two-phase empirical design, I show that accretive repurchases and discretionary accruals are strongly substitutional, especially when repurchases occur earlier in the quarter, leading to a more pronounced accretive effect. In contrast, the link between accretive repurchases and real earnings management is inconclusive, with a horserace among all earnings management tools revealing that managers prioritize accretive repurchases and discretionary accruals over real earnings management methods. Further analyses show that prior discretionary accrual use constrains the ability to use accruals in the current period, exacerbating the substitutive effect. Finally, I find that managers are more likely to undertake the trade-off of discretionary accruals with accretive repurchases when they have a larger base of transient (short-horizon) investors, suggesting a myopic focus on meeting immediate earnings expectations.
