Abstract

Motivated by Hart and Moore (1994)’s theoretical framework on inalienable human capital and debt contracting, we empirically investigate how firms adjust their capital structure in response to increased human capital mobility risk. Exploiting the staggered rejection of the inevitable disclosure doctrine (IDD), which potentially facilitates key talent outflows, we find that treated firms exhibit a statistically significant increase in private debt reliance relative to public debt. This effect is amplified for firms that are more reliant on key human capital, with weaker financial fundamentals, higher information asymmetries, and facing less intensified product market competition. In addition, evidence based on state-level variations in noncompete agreement (NCA) enforceability as an alternative proxy for human capital mobility confirms the external validity of the main findings. Our study underscores the importance of renegotiation flexibility and enhanced monitoring associated with private debt in managing the heightened risk of human capital loss.

Keywords: Debt choice, Human capital, Labor mobility, Debt contracting, Private debt
