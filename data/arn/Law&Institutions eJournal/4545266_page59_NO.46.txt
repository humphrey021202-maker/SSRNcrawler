Abstract

This study investigates the impact of directors' foreign experience on corporate environmental disclosure in Chinese listed firms (2009-2017). Findings reveal a significant positive relationship, particularly in non-state-owned enterprises where directors exert greater influence. In industries with high energy consumption, pollution, or overcapacity, the effect is strengthened by having at least three experienced directors or foreign members in the audit committee. Experiential diversity outweighs board gender and independence diversity in shaping environmental disclosure practices. The study highlights the need for policymakers and firms to prioritize the recruitment of directors with diverse experiences to enhance environmental transparency.

Keywords: board of directors, Foreign experience, Environmental information disclosure, Corporate disclosure policy
