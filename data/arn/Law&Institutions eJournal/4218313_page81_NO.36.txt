Abstract

We examine the motivations for and effects of institutional investor engagements in Japan using proprietary data of three large asset managers from 2017–2019, when demand for responsible investment spiked in response to the revised Stewardship Code of 2017. Our statistical analysis of over 3,000 engagement datasets reveals that investors engage with firms with poor governance when they have high stakes in the firms. Further, target firms improve governance and financial performance in the post-engagement period. Thus, even in Japan where investors have historically not been active in monitoring, investor engagements can be effective under an appropriate regulatory environment.

Keywords: Institutional Investors, Free-Rider Problem, Private Engagement, Corporate Governance, Stewardship Code

JEL Classification: G23, G28, G32, G38
