Abstract

Purpose: This study examines the impact of adopting Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) on accounting quality, transparency, and financial reporting practices among Central Public Sector Undertakings (CPSUs). The objective is to analyze whether the transition from Indian GAAP to Ind AS has enhanced the reliability and comparability of financial information. Design/Methodology/Approach: A blended research design was used, integrating descriptive and inferential methods. Primary information was obtained through a structured questionnaire distributed to finance and accounting experts employed in CPSUs. To validate the hypotheses on awareness, uniformity, application of fair value, and professional perception of Ind AS, statistical techniques including the t-test, chi-square test, and regression analysis were applied. Findings: The analysis reveals notable progress in financial transparency and fair value reporting after the adoption of Ind AS. However, challenges remain in terms of awareness, technical knowledge, and consistent application among professionals. The findings highlight that while Ind AS adoption strengthens accounting quality, it also requires on-going capacity building. Originality/Value: This research enriches to the limited body of literature on Ind AS adoption in CPSUs by linking accounting reforms with practitioners’ perceptions. The study provides insights for policymakers, regulators, and academicians into the practical implications of Ind AS convergence with IFRS in India.
