Abstract

Political alignment between CEOs and director candidates increases appointment probability by 5%, controlling for other connections. This effect strengthens during periods of heightened political polarization and following CEOs' exposure to partisan media. CEOs strategically appoint political allies during performance declines and before acquisitions to enhance advisory capacity. Appointing aligned directors yields higher announcement returns when firms have higher advising needs. Lacking effective oversight, these directors command higher pay and retain their seats. Our evidence reveals how political homophily influences board composition and generates meaningful consequences for shareholder value.

Keywords: Political Homophily, Board of Directors, Board Monitoring, Board Advising JEL Code: G32, G34
