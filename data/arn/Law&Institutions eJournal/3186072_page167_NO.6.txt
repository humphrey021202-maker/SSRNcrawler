Abstract

This paper uses Chief Executive Officer (CEO) facial features to examine the association between CEO masculinity and bank risk-taking. Given that high facial width-to-height ratio has been linked to high testosterone levels and masculine behavioral traits such as increased risk tolerance, aggression, and sensation seeking, we postulate a positive relationship between CEO facial masculinity and bank risk-taking. Consistent with this prediction, we document that banks led by CEOs with more masculine facial features are associated with more volatile stock returns and higher levels of idiosyncratic risk.

Keywords: CEO Masculinity, Facial Width-to-Height Ratio, fWHR, Bank Risk-Taking
