Abstract

Motivated by recent work measuring the completeness of economic models (Fudenberg et al., 2022), this paper combines machine-learning algorithms with the corporate governance literature to provide a new perspective on the role of contextual factors in governance choices. We show that observed context predicts significant variation in out-of-sample governance structure. However, the impact of context is highly nonlinear, and incorporating nonlinearities through the random-forest algorithm substantially improves predictive accuracy. We also propose an algorithmic method to obtain information about unobserved context, which further increases predictive accuracy. A new measure of governance quality derived from our approach, context consistent governance (CCG), outperforms unconditional governance indices and highlights the value of integrating context into the measurement of corporate governance.

Keywords: Corporate governance, machine learning, artificial intelligence, contextual factors
