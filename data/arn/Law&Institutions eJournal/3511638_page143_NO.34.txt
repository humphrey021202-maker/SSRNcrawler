Abstract

We examine the relation between CEO risk taking equity incentives, as captured by CEO vega, and workplace misconduct. Workplace misconduct includes health and safety violations, non-compliance with labor laws, and other violations broadly related to labor exploitation, and it results in significant economic costs. Using regression analysis, matched sample tests, and a quasi-natural experiment we find a positive relation between CEO vega and workplace misconduct. We identify a reduction in discretionary expenses and increased employee workload as channels through which CEO vega affects workplace misconduct.

Keywords: Workplace Misconduct, Executive Compensation, Risk taking Equity Incentives

JEL Classification: G30, G32, G34
