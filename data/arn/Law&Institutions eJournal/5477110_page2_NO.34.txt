Abstract

This study investigates the levels of, and change in, institutional ownership around fraudulent 10-K filings.   Consistent with performance pressure encouraging firms to commit fraud, fraudulent firms exhibit higher ownership levels by transient institu- tions in the quarters prior to accounting fraud.  In contrast, higher ownership levels by non-transient institutions reflect a monitoring role that correlates with lower likeli- hood of accounting fraud. Following the release of fraudulent annual reports, transient institutions increase their holdings, suggesting their reaction to distorted signals em- bedded in misleading disclosures.  In contrast, non-transient institutions appear less influenced by these signals and more likely to rely on information advantage when adjusting their positions. Incorporating ownership metrics—disaggregated by investor type—significantly improves fraud detection models, outperforming the Beneish M- Score.  These results suggest that institutional ownership reflects information useful for early fraud identification and that investor heterogeneity plays a crucial role in shaping firms’ incentives and market integrity.

Keywords: Institutional Investors, Accounting Fraud, M-Score, 10-K
