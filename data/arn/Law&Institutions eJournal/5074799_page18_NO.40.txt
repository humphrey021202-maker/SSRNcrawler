Abstract

Although Form 8-K rules mandate that firms report material events shortly after they occur, a limited safe harbor allows firms to delay disclosure of certain events if they arise or are discovered concurrently with preparation of the upcoming 10-K/Q filing. Additionally, the materiality thresholds used to determine whether a filing is required are subject to managerial discretion. Given these features that provide flexibility in 8-K reporting, our study uses 8-K Item 2.06 Material Impairments as a setting to investigate how frequently firms disclose information on an 8-K, relative to their 10-K/Q disclosures. Using a 2005-2020 sample period, we find that an 8-K Item 2.06 is filed in only 9.84% of firm-quarters with 10-K/Q impairments. We then examine managerial incentives underlying the 8-K Item 2.06 filing choice and find a greater likelihood of filing in quarters where stock options are granted and where insider stock purchases are higher, and a reduced likelihood when raising capital. Further analyses explore the safe harbor and materiality choice as mechanisms, as well as the effect of consecutive losses on the 8-K filing choice. Overall, our study demonstrates the rarity in which firms disclose impairments on a current basis and provides evidence of a relation between managerial incentives and the choice to file an 8-K for mandatory reportable events.
