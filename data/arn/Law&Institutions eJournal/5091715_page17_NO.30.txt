Abstract

This paper examines the pricing of ESG (i.e., environmental, social, and governance) in product markets. Price effects may be demand-driven reflecting consumers’ willingness to pay for ESG outcomes or supply-driven, as firms pass ESG-related costs onto consumers. For identification, we focus on ESG-related incidents in the airline industry, which offers comprehensive public data on consumer prices. We find that airlines increase ticket prices following ESG incidents, with price effects being more pronounced when consumers are less elastic, airlines are more elastic, or the demand-side effect is weaker. Collectively, our results suggest that consumers at least in part bear the cost of ESG initiatives, and that ESG-related price increases cannot be fully attributed to consumer demand for improved environmental or social outcomes.

Keywords: ESG outcomes, consumer reactions, consumer prices, climate action

JEL Classification: D22, M14, M41, H22
