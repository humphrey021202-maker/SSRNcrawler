Abstract

Research Question/Issue: Many mergers destroy shareholder value because managers waste corporate resources to pursue private benefits. This paper considers poor conditions in the acquirer industry as a novel external disciplining mechanism that mitigates agency problems in takeovers. Research Findings/Insights: Using textual analysis, we build a new measure of industry conditions based on acquirer peers' 10-K statements. We link this measure to acquirer announcement abnormal returns and find that more negative industry conditions are associated with higher abnormal returns. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our results suggest that poor industry conditions impose discipline on managers who then tend to focus on deals that create value for acquirer shareholders. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Shareholders can rely on better alignment of interests with their managers during poorer industry conditions.
