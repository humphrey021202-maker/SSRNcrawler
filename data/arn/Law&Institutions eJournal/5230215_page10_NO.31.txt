Abstract

The improvement of profitability to achieve financial growth is driven by technological implementation, process improvement, and optimal capital structure. This study investigates the effect of structural and capitalemployed efficiency on the financial performance of listed consumer goods companies in Nigeria. An ex-post facto research design was used on the panel data utilizing purposive sampling techniques to select a sample size of twelve (12) from a population of twenty-one (21) listed consumer goods in Nigeria. The study covered the period from 2013 to 2023 and employed multiple regression techniques using STATA 13 software. The results reveal that structural capital and capital-employed efficiency positively and significantly affect financial performance. This study concludes that structural and capital-employed efficiencies significantly affect the financial performance of listed consumer goods companies in Nigeria. The study, therefore, recommends that firms should work to maximize their structural capital by developing internal processes and exploiting organizational knowledge. Firms should also establish strong financial management through optimal capital structure to improve their capital investment efficiency.
