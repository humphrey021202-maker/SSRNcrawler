Abstract

This paper analyzes the effect of family ownership on a company’s tax avoidance practices in Indonesia. This study also analyzes whether there is a change in tax avoidance practice after the tax amnesty program implemented in 2015-2016. We used three measurements to capture tax avoidance practices, (a) effective tax rate, (b) cash effective tax rate, and (c) book-tax difference. Our sample for this study is forty-nine non-state-owned non-financial private Indonesian firms who participated in the tax amnesty program 2015-2016. This study covered data for the 2013 to 2017 period divided into before tax amnesty and post-tax amnesty program. We found that family ownership has a positive impact on tax avoidance practice. In other words, family-own companies avoid tax payments more aggressively compared to non-family own companies. However, despite the regulator expected the tax amnesty program to reduce the company’s tax avoidance practice, we found different results. The company’s tax avoidance behavior does not change even when tax authorities have implemented a tax amnesty program.
