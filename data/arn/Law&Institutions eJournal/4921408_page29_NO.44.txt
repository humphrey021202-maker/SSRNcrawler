Cash Outflows, Bank Dividends, and Risk-Shifting

Abstract

Empirical evidence from recent economic crises suggests that providing liquidity in response to macroeconomic shocks exposes banks to asset-side cash outflow risk. We show that cash outflow risk influences banks’ dividend policies by incentivizing shareholders to receive cash before the shock hits the economy. While banks need deposit insurance to pursue their primary role of risk transformation, it allows banks to engage in risk-shifting by increasing dividends and reducing capital levels. Although capital regulations can limit banks’ risk-shifting, bank dividends and risk are positively related when cash outflow risk increases and negatively related when investment return increases. When cash outflow risk is high, dividend restrictions are more effective than capital requirements in limiting bank risk. We provide possible explanations for the variation in banks’ dividend policies during the 2007-2009 global financial crisis. We also provide a possible rationale for introducing dividend restrictions at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Keywords: Cash outflows, Bank dividends, Risk-shifting, Capital regulations, Dividend restrictions.
