Abstract

This study investigates whether the ability of top management teams (TMTs) influences efficient just-in-time (JIT) inventory management. Using a sample of U.S. listed firms spanning the period 1987 to 2018, our analyses, via mediation and moderation tests, show that more able TMTs enhance firm performance through efficient JIT inventory management. Our study highlights the importance of talented TMTs in contributing to efficient JIT inventory management that translates to shareholder value maximization.

Keywords: Inventory management; Just in time; Managerial ability; Top Management Teams; Firm Performance
