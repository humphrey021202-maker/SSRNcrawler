Corporate Tax Breaks and Executive Compensation

Date Written: March 2022

Abstract

I analyze the effect of two corporate tax breaks, bonus depreciation and the Domestic Production Activities Deduction (DPAD), on executive compensation in publicly traded US firms. I find both tax breaks significantly increase executive compensation. For every dollar a firm benefits from the tax breaks, compensation of the firm's top five highest paid executives increases by 17 to 25 cents. The tax breaks increase compensation primarily in firms with weaker governance structures, suggesting the compensation response is driven by executive rent extraction.

Keywords: corporate taxation, executive compensation

JEL Classification: H25, M12
