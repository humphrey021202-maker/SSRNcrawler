Abstract

This paper empirically explores the effect of monetary policy uncertainty on corporate cash holdings in China. We find robust evidence that monetary policy uncertainty is positively related to corporate cash holdings. The firms’ precautionary behavior in cash holdings is chiefly attributed to the increase in financial frictions rather than the reduction in corporate investments. The promoting effect of monetary policy uncertainty on cash holdings is more pronounced among firms with more severe financial constraints, firms with higher dependence on external finance, firms with worse access to bank financing, and non-SOEs, and during the period of monetary policy tightening. Our study suggests that firms hold more cash to cushion potential liquidity shortfalls induced by the increase in monetary policy uncertainty.

Keywords: Monetary Policy Uncertainty, Cash Holdings, Financial Friction, Real Option

JEL Classification: E52, G31, G32, G34
