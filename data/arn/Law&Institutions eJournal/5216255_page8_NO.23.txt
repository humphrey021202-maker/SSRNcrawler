Abstract

Machine learning (ML) is an increasingly important technology in the financial services industry, especially in audit, internal control, and operational risk management. This study seeks to provide a theoretical basis and practical ML application in risk assessment and valuation processes. Using case studies in auditing (GL. ai, DARTbot) and operational risk (e.g., fraud detection and loss prediction), the article explains how ML helps better identify risk, increase accuracy, and increase efficiency. It also discusses more specific items being addressed, such as data governance, model transparency and AI ethics, which it discusses through reference to COSO and regulatory guidance. The findings illustrate how ML can improve the effectiveness and reach of risk management functions in the financial sector when used under strong controls and deep domain understanding (Ashraf et al., 2025).

Keywords: Machine Learning, Risk Assessment, Audit, Internal Control, Operational Risk, Fraud Detection, Artificial Intelligence, Financial Sector
