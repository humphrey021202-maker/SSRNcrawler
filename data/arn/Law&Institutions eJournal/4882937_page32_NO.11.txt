Abstract

As climate risks became a rising concern, a unified framework of climate governance is lacking. This study bridges the gap using 44 policy-makers’ reports and adopting Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic-modeling approach. It unveils a unified framework of climate governance based on five pillars: strategic and operational climate governance, actors, inputs and outcomes. It shows that climate governance is an integrated (top-down and bottom-up) process and part of a comprehensive system. These findings contribute to (i) research and policy-making by documenting the multiple dimensions of climate governance, and (ii) practice by providing a step-by-step procedure for climate governance implementation.

Keywords: climate governance, climate risk, Corporate governance, qualitative research, unsupervised machine learning
