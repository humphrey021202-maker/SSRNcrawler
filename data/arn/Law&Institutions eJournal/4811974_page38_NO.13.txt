Abstract

Purpose: The paper investigates if board composition affects corporate sustainability (CS) ambitions in private firms. We also study a possible interplay between CS-ambitions and CS-reporting regulations.
Design/methodology/approach: We surveyed the CEOs, CFOs, and Environment Officers of Swedish private firms and received 160 valid responses (response rate 27%). The respondents qualitatively explained CS-ambitions of their firms. We coded using categories proposed by van Marrewijk and Werre (2003), namely: law-abiding, compliance-driven, profit-driven, caring, synergistic, and holistic. We explained the CS ambition-level with board characteristics.
Findings: While on average our sample firms have a profit-driven CS ambition-level, we find that CS ambition-level is positively driven by female Chair, female CEO and external CEO. Early voluntary reporting before EU Directive 2014/95/EU (NFRD) doesn’t explain CS ambition-level. On adoption, mandatory reporters increased resources spent on CS-activities and CS-reporting more than early voluntary-reporters. Still, many of our sample firms reported no significant impact of NFRD.
Originality: We focus on private firms, embraced by Swedish regulations already following NFRD. Methodologically, the use of a survey is an extension of previous reliance on archival research.
Practical implications: Our findings are useful for stakeholders interested in corporate governance and firms’ CS-ambitions. Also, our findings support further regulation, such as EU Directive 2022/2464 (CSRD).
Social implications: Female gender seems to play an important role in increasing CS-ambitions in private firms.

Keywords: corporate sustainability ambitions, private firms, board diversity, female CEO, female chair, external CEO, sustainability regulations.
