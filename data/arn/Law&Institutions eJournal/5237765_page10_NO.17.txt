Abstract

This study investigates the transformative role of Machine Learning (ML) in modernizing Management Control Systems (MCS) within public sector organizations and large enterprises. Using a mixed-methods approach and data from over 4,500 companies (2015–2023) via Bloomberg, we examine how ML enhances decision-making, predictive analytics, and operational agility.

We apply a range of ML models—including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines—to demonstrate significant improvements in MCS performance. A case study of CorpX, a leading multinational, illustrates how ML can support the transition to dynamic, data-informed control systems.

Beyond technical gains, the paper explores ethical challenges in ML integration, including data governance and algorithmic transparency, highlighting the need for responsible digital management. Our findings suggest ML can revolutionize control systems in both public and corporate settings, offering a pathway to more responsive and accountable governance.
