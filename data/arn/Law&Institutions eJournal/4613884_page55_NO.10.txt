Abstract

A firm’s performance-ranking within a director’s small set of interlocked firms predicts board meeting attendance and forced CEO turnovers, controlling for firm performance. The findings hold after including firm-by-CEO, firm-by-year, or director-by-year fixed effects, using instrumental-variable and difference-in-difference frameworks, and in falsification tests that reshuffle interlocks. As such, they provide clean estimates that individual directors influence CEO dismissals by following an availability heuristic. Consistent with biased decision-making, such CEO dismissals lead to worse performance and analyst downgrades. Overall, the findings put forth a new channel through which interlocking boards affect corporate governance by introducing implicit relative performance benchmarks.

Keywords: Corporate governance, Boards, Independent directors, Firm performance, Interlocking directorates, Availability bias
