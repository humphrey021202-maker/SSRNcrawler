Abstract

This paper develops a theoretical model to investigate the trade-offs of regulating bank dividends. The regulator faces a time inconsistency problem: by intervening in banks' payout policy ex-post, it destroys incentives to accumulate excess capital ex-ante. We solve the intervention game and show that regulators in equilibrium only restrict payouts for sufficiently bad state realizations. Thus, there is a redistribution of system-wide (excess) capital across states, induced by dividend-smoothing demand in moderate crisis states. This provides a novel explanation for how dividend smoothing creates value. The model has implications regarding the design of the regulatory framework for ex-post interventions.

Keywords: Financial Regulation, Dividends, Banking Theory
