Abstract

This study examines the influence of pre-disclosure market uncertainty on managers' COVID-19 disclosure decisions. We find that high pre-disclosure market uncertainty reduces both the quantity and negative tone of COVID-19 disclosure in 10-Q filings. However, managers respond to this uncertainty by increasing COVID-19 disclosure in conference calls. Our findings show that litigation risk drives the strategic shift between formal and informal communication channels. These insights highlight the nuanced strategies that managers employ to navigate market uncertainty during crises.

Keywords: market uncertainty, COVID-19 disclosure levels, disclosure tone

JEL Classification: G14, G12
