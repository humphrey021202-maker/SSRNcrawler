Abstract

The escalating cyber threat amplifies the pressure on Boards of Directors to bolster cyber risk management. This paper employs bibliographic review to comprehend the capabilities of boards in overseeing cyber risks, assessing effectiveness, and identifying gaps to enhance board oversight. The analysis unveils cyber incident-prone geographic regions for firms, the most cited fields in cyber governance, key topics, emerging research frontiers, and empirical efforts. We conclude by outlining future research directions in cyber risk governance and identifying theoretical models that have been underexplored to advance research scholarship.

Keywords: Bibliographic review, Corporate governance, Cybersecurity, Cyber Risk, Board of Directors.
