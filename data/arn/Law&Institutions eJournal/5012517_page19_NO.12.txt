Abstract

The Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) legislation redefines corporate purpose by introducing a new legal form of corporate structure, the for-benefit corporation, which must include public benefits in its certificate of incorporation. We posit that PBC legislation facilitates a division of corporate forms in pursuing public benefits, effectively legitimizing the shift of social responsibility away from traditional for-profit corporations. Exploiting the staggered enactment of PBC legislation across U.S. states, we find that for-profit corporations reduce their socially responsible activities in response to PBC legislation. Mechanism analyses reveal two primary channels driving this effect: increased costs due to heightened fiduciary incompatibility and reduced benefits stemming from diminished credibility of CSR commitments. Further, we show that for-profit corporations become more shareholder-centric at the expense of stakeholders following PBC legislation, leading to improved financial performance. Finally, we find an increase in state-level pollution. Overall, we provide novel evidence that PBC legislation has unintended real effects on traditional for-profit corporations and generates negative externalities for society.

Keywords: Corporate Purposes, Fiduciary Duties, Public Benefits, Stakeholderism, Social Externalities
