Abstract

Theoretically, increased risk-taking incentives should benefit equity holders at the expense
of creditors. However, we find that increases in CEO risk-taking incentives (vega)
are associated with better outcomes for creditors. Specifically, credit ratings and credit
default swaps both improve following increases in vega. This effect is magnified for
firms close to default. Within the Merton (1974) framework, our findings suggest that
increased risk-taking incentives induce managers to take on more positive net present
value projects. Consequently, while higher vega increases the risk of the firm, our results
imply that it also increases the expected value of the firm, reducing its credit risk.

Keywords: compensation, credit risk, risk taking
