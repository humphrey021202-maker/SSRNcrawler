Abstract

We create a firm-level ChatGPT investment score, based on conference calls, that measures managers’ anticipated changes in capital expenditures. We validate the score with interpretable textual content and its strong correlation with CFO survey responses. The investment score predicts future capital expenditure for up to nine quarters, controlling for Tobin’s q and other determinants, implying the investment score provides incremental information about firms’ future investment opportunities. Consistent with theoretical predictions, high-investment-score firms experience significant positive short-term returns upon disclosure, and negative long-run future abnormal returns. We demonstrate ChatGPT’s applicability to measure other policies, such as dividends and employment.

Keywords: AI, ChatGPT, Corporate Investment, Corporate Policies, Large Language Model, Managerial Expectations, Market Efficiency, Textual analysis
