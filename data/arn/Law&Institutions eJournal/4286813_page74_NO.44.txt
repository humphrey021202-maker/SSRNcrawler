Abstract

We study whether improved managerial reporting quality (MRQ) results in better investment decisions, assess the information frictions reduced by improved MRQ, and examine the adoption frictions that reduce firms’ voluntary MRQ improvements. We use the Sarbanes-Oxley Act’s provisions related to internal control assessment and attestation to capture an exogenous improvement in MRQ. Our baseline finding is that improved MRQ leads to better investment efficiency. Using site-level data on internal information and communication systems spending, and measures of information asymmetries between segment and firm managers, we find results consistent with the MRQ improvements resulting from SOX 404 reducing an information friction related to internal moral hazard risk. Finally, we find evidence consistent with adoption frictions related to insulation from competition, difficulty of access to ERP systems, and lack of internal control personnel limiting firms’ voluntary improvements to MRQ before SOX 404.

Keywords: Managerial reporting, information frictions, Sarbanes-Oxley, internal controls, investment efficiency, information technology
