Abstract

This paper examines whether the presence of foreign board members leads to higher dividend yield in top Egyptian listed companies. Using a sample of the top 50 firms listed on the Egyptian Exchange between 2005 and 2014, I found that there is a significant positive relationship between board national diversity and dividend yield. This paper contributes to the literature by investigating a novel board diversity variable's relationship with dividend policies.

Keywords: Board Diversity, Dividend, Egypt
