Abstract

Private investment fund regulation in the United States evolved substantially in the last two decades. Tracing the main regulatory developments, this article summarizes the author’s theoretical and empirical findings on the effects of changes in private investment fund regulation from 2006 to 2016, assessing the regulatory implications of the failure of Long-Term Capital Management L.P. in 1998 and the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010. More recent trends include the emerging confluence of private investment funds and mutual funds as well as private investment funds’ use of blockchain technology and smart contracts.
