Abstract

This paper introduces the Discrete Costing Rule-a formal criterion for cost inclusion that redefines cost attribution as a causal, falsifiable act rather than a managerial convention. Drawing on epistemological principles and resolution-aware logic, it challenges the orthodox foundations of management accounting, where cost allocations are often based on heuristics devoid of causal coherence. The framework posits that a cost is admissible in profitability analysis at a given analytic resolution only if its existence depends on that unit's existence. From this rule, a suite of corollaries is derived, exposing the ontological illegitimacy of common allocation methods and reframing corporate overhead as a testable hypothesis of surplus value generation. By integrating this logic into simulation-based architectures, particularly within Value Driver Tree-based Monte Carlo models, the paper demonstrates how accounting systems can transition from descriptive artefacts to tools of causal inference. The result is a shift from apportionment to epistemic disciplinetransforming costing from a mechanical process into a diagnostic of organisational coherence. In doing so, this paper situates cost attribution as a site of epistemic power, revealing how conventional accounting practices serve to obscure organisational control structures under the guise of technical neutrality. The Discrete Costing Rule restores falsifiability and causal integrity, enabling a more transparent, emancipatory basis for organisational analysis and intervention.
