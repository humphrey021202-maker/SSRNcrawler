Abstract

This paper offers a methodological innovation by developing a braided framework that weaves Dialogic Accounting and Talanoa through the He Awa Whiria model. This braided approach provides a culturally responsive pathway for conducting pluralistic, relational accounting in Indigenous and Western contexts. It encourages critical reflection, inclusivity, and stakeholder engagement. This paper advocates for theoretical pluralism and acknowledges accounting practices’ social, political, and cultural embeddedness. Rather than engaging indigenous perspectives, this paper advocates weaving Talanoa in reshaping accounting practices to ensure that alternative worldviews are not marginalised. Talanoa (a Pacific methodology) is a culturally grounded methodology that aligns with these principles. Rooted in storytelling and collective dialogue, Talanoa fosters relational accountability and ensures decision-making within the Pacific values and lived experiences. He Awa Whiria (braided rivers) is a Māori metaphor that provides an understanding of how Dialogic Accounting and Talanoa can interact in a way that allows both methodologies to work alongside each other while honouring their distinctiveness and enabling each to meaningfully contribute to the research process.

Keywords: Dialogic accounting, Talanoa, He Awa Whiria (Braded river)
