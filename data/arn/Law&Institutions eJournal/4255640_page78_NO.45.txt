Abstract

Agency problems between senior managers and investors give rise to earnings expectation games that, together with the limits to arbitrage described by Shleifer and Vishny (1997), pave the way for overvaluation to emerge and persist (Jensen 2005). We predict that by imposing timelier recognition of bad vs. good news in earnings, conditional conservatism limits the incidence of earnings games, thereby attenuating overvaluation. Consistent with our prediction, we find that more conditionally conservative firms are less likely to be overvalued. We also document smaller penalties for conservative firms when they miss earnings forecasts. To strengthen causal inference, we study the passage of SFAS 121 as a plausible exogenous shock to conservatism and find consistent evidence.

Keywords: conditional conservatism, overvalued equity, duration of equity overvaluation, abnormal short interest, short sale constraints, rewards from target beating

JEL Classification: G30, M41
