Abstract

This paper presents an extensive analysis of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), derived from a careful synthesis of the 100 most cited studies in the field, as of January 1, 2024. Our research methodologically sourced citation counts from two leading academic databases: Web of Science and Google Scholar. This range of citations showcases the breadth of the field, with the most cited paper garnering 6,212 citations and the least cited, though lower in number, maintaining considerable academic significance with 162 citations. The paper explores the multifaceted nature of CSR, emphasizing its diverse applications across various geographies and industries, and its profound impact on corporate image and stakeholder relationships.

Central to this analysis is the recognition of the cultural and economic diversity inherent in CSR approaches, highlighting how regional contexts distinctly shape CSR strategies. The study delves deep into the correlation between CSR activities and corporate reputation, illustrating CSR’s escalating role in molding public perception and enhancing stakeholder engagement. This is particularly evident in the nuanced examination of CSR's role across different industries, where specific challenges and best practices are identified, especially in sectors like banking and pharmaceuticals.

Furthermore, the paper investigates the intricate link between CSR and business competitiveness, revealing CSR's potential as a strategic tool in promoting sustainable growth. This comprehensive synthesis not only offers a broad overview of the current state of CSR research but also paves the way for future explorations into CSR implementation and study. By dissecting and correlating these high-impact studies, the paper aims to contribute significantly to the understanding and advancement of CSR as a vital element in modern business strategy and ethical practice.

Keywords: CSR, cultural and economic diversity, sustainable growth, business strategy
