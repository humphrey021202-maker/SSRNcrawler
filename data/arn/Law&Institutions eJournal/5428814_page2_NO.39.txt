Abstract

This research paper critically examines the implications of excessive mandatory disclosure in corporate law, challenging the notion that increased transparency invariably prevents wrongdoing and enhances market efficiency. Drawing on key scholarly works, it argues that overbroad disclosure requirements can lead to information overload, resource misallocation, and deadweight losses. The analysis further highlights necessary conditions for effective disclosure, emphasising standardised, objective historical data to mitigate agency costs and information asymmetry, while cautioning against burdensome ESG reporting and unquantifiable metrics. Methodological challenges in policy evaluation are addressed, advocating empirical tools like principal component regression and natural experiments to test causal effects while accounting for reflexivity and endogeneity. The paper concludes that balanced disclosure rules, grounded in economic theory, are essential to optimise social welfare without fostering regulatory overreach.
