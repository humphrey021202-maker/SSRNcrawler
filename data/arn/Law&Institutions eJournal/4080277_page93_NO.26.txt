Abstract

This study aims to predict the dividend payout policy of 211 Turkish firms based on firm-level variables such as cash flow, sales, the age of the firm, earnings per share, etc. Two advanced machine learning algorithms, XGBoost and multi-layer neural networks, are used to classify dividend payout policies. Both algorithms are successful at predicting policy class, but XGBoost gives better results by using additional analysis to find the best hypermeters. Precision and recall values are also analyzed, with each algorithm again providing highly accurate predictions for each of these metrics with approximately 0.8. Using XGBoost’s feature importance module, the most determinant factors influencing this prediction are found to be cash flow and size.

Keywords: XGBoost, MLNN, Dividend Policy, Turkey, Machine Learning
