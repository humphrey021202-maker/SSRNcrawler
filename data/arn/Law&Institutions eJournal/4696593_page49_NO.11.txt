Abstract

With the growing environmental awareness among the public, many enterprises engage in greenwashing behaviors through misleading information disclosure. Such actions deviate from the original concept of sustainable development. Therefore, this research aims to comprehensively investigate the digital economy plays a significant role in suppressing greenwashing by constructing a unique panel of data spanning from 2012 to 2021. In terms of mechanism exploration, this research reveals the positive and reinforcing effects of information transparency and external  supervision on curbing greenwashing in the digital economy. Finally, we further find that the digital economy improves firms' overall environmental, social responsibility and profitability performance by curbing firms' greenwashing behaviour. This research proves the impact of the digital economy on corporate greenwashing, providing a valuable reference for sustainable development and corporate social responsibility practices.

Keywords: Digital economy, Greenwashing, Information transparency, External supervision, Enterprise performance
