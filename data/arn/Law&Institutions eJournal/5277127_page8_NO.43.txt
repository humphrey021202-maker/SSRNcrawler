Abstract

This paper examines the stock market's ability to detect and penalise greenwashingmisrepresentations of environmental responsibility-among fintech firms. We document price declines in fintech firms publicly implicated in greenwashing, with the effect more pronounced in smaller firms and firms with low book-to-market ratios. Additionally, in the two days preceding such news releases, a negative price effect is present, indicating information leakage or anticipatory selling. Contrary to expectations, direct environmental misbehaviour does not systematically elicit larger reactions. The results imply that equity markets can provide market-based penalties in the absence of formal enforcement. The results also highlight the complexity of investor decision-making in contexts where firms are particularly opaque.

Keywords: Greenwashing, Fintech, Reputation, ESG, CSR
