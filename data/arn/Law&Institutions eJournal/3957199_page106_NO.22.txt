Abstract

To enforce insider trading laws, financial regulators require top executives to make their owncompany trades public. One implication of this regulatory focus is that executives below the top fly under the radar. We use administrative register data from Norway to examine whether executives below the top in listed companies earn abnormal returns on purchases in own-company stock. We find evidence of abnormal returns on such trades, about 50 to 100 basis points at the 1month horizon. The abnormal returns on purchases in other stocks are negative, making high investor ability an unlikely explanation.

Keywords: insider trading, executives, employees, regulation

JEL Classification: G30, G32, G38
