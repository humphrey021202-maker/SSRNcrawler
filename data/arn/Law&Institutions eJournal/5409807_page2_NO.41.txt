Abstract

Facing the pressure to meet short-term earnings expectations, corporate managers often take actions that are thought to be value-destroying. Our study provides empirical evidence supporting an alternative view: Given agency problems, earnings pressure may force the managers to refocus on the firm’s core products through cost-cutting of non-core products, which can be value-enhancing. As predicted, product refocus under earnings pressure is stronger when the managers ex ante exhibit high-level agency problems. For identification, we exploit the setting of analyst brokerage mergers and closures. Our study suggests a bright side of earnings pressure − it helps reduce agency-motivated product diversification.
