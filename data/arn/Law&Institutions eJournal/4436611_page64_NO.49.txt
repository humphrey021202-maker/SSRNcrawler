Abstract

This study examines the relation between managerial risk tolerance and corporate credit ratings. Using pilot licensing status as a proxy for managerial risk tolerance, we find that firms led by pilot CEOs receive worse credit ratings, suggesting that highly risk-tolerant CEOs impair their firms’ credit ratings. Further analyses of the underlying mechanisms show that highly risk-tolerant CEOs harm their firms’ ratings by adopting more aggressive financial policies, engaging less in (effective) risk management, and participating in other aggressive firm behaviors. The negative association between CEO risk tolerance and credit ratings is stronger when a firm faces high financial risk, and its CEO plays a dominant role in the management team. Additional analyses show that higher CEO risk tolerance is associated with wider credit spreads but not stock price crash or jump risks. Overall, our evidence implies that managerial risk tolerance plays an important role in influencing corporate credit ratings and highlights that highly risk-tolerant managers damage debt investors’ welfare but provide no net benefits to equity investors.

Keywords: Managerial risk tolerance; pilot CEO; corporate credit rating; credit risk; investor welfare
