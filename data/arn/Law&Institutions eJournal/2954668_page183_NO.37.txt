Abstract

Corporate governance research in the context of emerging economies has received increasing attention in recent years. Corporate scandals and executive failures continue despite the growing emphasis on governance reforms around the world and the increasing activism of shareholders, governments and other corporate stakeholders. Academics and practitioners are becoming aware that firm-level governance mechanisms at work in different countries are embedded in national business systems and are influenced by political, social and legal macro-institutions. To promote the studies on governance challenges in emerging markets, we organized a special issue conference in conjunction with Corporate Governance: An International Review (CGIR) in Edinburgh, UK on December 4-5, 2015 on the theme of “Challenges in Corporate Governance in Emerging Economies”. In this article, we introduce peculiarities of corporate governance in emerging economies, survey the papers included in the special issue and explore future research directions.

Keywords: CEO Turnover; Corruption; Corporate Governance; Crash Risk; Emerging Markets; Institutional Transition; Managerial Compensation; Principal‐Principal Agency Problems
