Abstract

Recent SEC regulations mandate that hedge fund advisers provide their investors with narrative disclosures of their business and operations. We find that 40% of these regulatory disclosures omit information regarding advisers' operational and investment risks when compared to other sources of public information. Funds with such "inconsistencies" are associated with predictably lower fund performance but do not differ in their fund flows, flow-performance relation, leverage, ownership structure, or management fees. The evidence is consistent with advisers' successful use of discretion to de-emphasize information with adverse performance implications in order to retain investors' capital, enabled by limited strategic thinking and low enforcement risk.

Keywords: Inconsistent disclosure, sophisticated investors, hedge funds, limited strategic thinking, enforcement, financial regulation JEL Classifications: G20, G23, G28, M41, M48
