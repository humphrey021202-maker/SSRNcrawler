Abstract

We document that conservatism has a confirmatory role: It lends credibility to voluntary disclosure. Conditional conservatism provides a hard reporting benchmark that allows outsiders to better evaluate the truthfulness of management forecasts. Focusing on a sample of US firms, we find that more conditionally conservative firms: (i) issue more management earnings forecasts, (ii) have lower serial correlation in consecutive management forecasts errors, and (iii) experience stronger market reactions to their forecasts. This evidence indicates greater credibility of hard voluntary disclosure. Importantly, we do not find evidence of this confirmatory role of conservatism for soft voluntary disclosures.

Keywords: Conditional conservatism, Voluntary disclosure, Confirmatory role, Credibility
