Abstract

Objective: The aim of this study was to analyze the existence of Bowman's Paradox (BP) in the context of Brazilian companies listed on Brazil, Bolsa, Balcão (B3).

Method: The descriptive study, using secondary data and with a quantitative approach, analyzed quarterly data, from the period 2008-2018, of 292 companies listed in B3 and a total of 9,387 firm observations/year.

Results: The evidence reinforced the hypothesis of a positive association between risk and return, both for market proxies and for accounting data. However, it was found that economic and/or regulatory uncertainties can affect the predictability of returns, resulting in a spurious negative relationship between risk and return.

Implications/Contributions: The results reinforce the assumptions of modern finance theory, especially the idea of a positive association between risk and return. It contributes to the debate on investment portfolio management in the Brazilian context, even using accounting data. The evidence has implications for investors, especially non-institutional ones and other economic agents who seek to understand the relevant variables in risky investment decision-making.


Keywords: Portfolio Selection; Risk-Return Binomial; Bowman's Paradox.
