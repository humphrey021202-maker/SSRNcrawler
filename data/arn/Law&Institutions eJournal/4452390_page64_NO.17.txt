Abstract

Prior research on firms often focuses on formal institutions such as contracts and incentives, yet a large part of organizational life is governed by informal, noncontractible factors. In this paper, we focus on one such powerful attribute: the cultural proximity between a firm's CEO and its board. Using novel, granular data, we construct a dyadic measure of cultural proximity between CEOs and their directors in US S&P 1500 firms based on first and last names. Grounded in a seminal theoretical framework, we predict and find that CEO–board cultural proximity exhibits substantial and persistent variation across firms, and evolves gradually over a CEO's tenure within a given firm. We also find that this cultural proximity has dual effects on key stakeholders. It is positively associated with greater internal cohesion, while it invites heightened external scrutiny.  Collectively, our findings demonstrate how an informal, noncontractible factor shapes stakeholder outcomes.

Keywords: Cultural Proximity, Identity Economics, Informal Control
