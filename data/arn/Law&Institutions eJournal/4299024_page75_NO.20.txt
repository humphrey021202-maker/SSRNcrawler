Abstract

We show that multi-segment firms keep value-relevant financial data items about their individual segments secret. Innovative firms in business equipment, chemical, and healthcare industries are the most reluctant to break out data across business lines, supporting proprietary concern drives segment secretiveness. In explaining the delay in the diffusion of information into a multi-segment firm’s stock prices and earnings forecasts, segment data granularity outperforms firmwide disclosure quality and operational complexity. A trading strategy exploiting secretive segments yields an annualized return of 13.8%. Our results highlight the importance of segment data to the information flows between multi-segment firms and the stock market.

Keywords: multi-segment firm; disaggregated information; segment line items; information processing; return predictability; analyst forecast.

JEL Classification: G10, G14, G18, M40, M41
