Abstract

We examine investor relations officers’ (IROs) disclosure decisions in private meetings with investors. We experimentally test how pre-disclosure materiality consideration, recommended by professional standards, affects disclosure to more and less preferred investors. Across two experiments, 258 experienced IROs respond to hypothetical investor questions. We find direct evidence that IROs provide more useful private disclosures to more preferred investors, even when less preferred investors ask the exact same questions. Further, materiality consideration dampens overall disclosure but does not reduce preferential disclosure. We also provide evidence that IROs are aware that they provide preferential disclosure to some investors. Finally, in semi-structured interviews, IROs indicate that they strive to maintain fairness in their communications, but strategic considerations influence the level of detail they provide to specific investors. Our results provide insights into how firms balance these strategic considerations with compliance within the current regulatory environment and have implications for firms and regulators.

Keywords: investor relations, private meetings, preferential disclosure, materiality, Regulation Fair Disclosure
