Abstract

This study examines the role of digital taxation in enhancing compliance and financial performance among Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Nigeria, with specific focus on Lagos, Kano, and Abuja. Using a mixed-methods research design, data were collected from 370 SMEs through structured questionnaires and semi-structured interviews with SME operators and Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) officials. Descriptive statistics, correlation, and regression analyses were used to assess the relationship between digital taxation, tax compliance, and SME sustainability, while thematic analysis was applied to qualitative responses. The findings reveal that adoption of e-tax platforms such as TaxPro-Max and e-payment systems is high, though formal training participation remains moderate. Digital taxation shows a strong positive correlation with tax compliance (r = 0.692, p < 0.05) and significantly influences financial performance, explaining 37.3% of its variation. Tax incentives were found to significantly moderate the relationship between digital taxation and SME sustainability. Qualitative insights indicate benefits such as time savings and transparency, alongside challenges related to internet infrastructure, cybersecurity, and technical support. The study concludes that digital taxation is a critical tool for improving SME compliance and financial performance in Nigeria. It recommends targeted taxpayer education, enhanced digital infrastructure, strengthened cybersecurity measures, and better management of tax incentives to maximize the benefits of e-tax systems.
