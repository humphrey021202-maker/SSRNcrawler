Abstract

This study advances the AI-Induced Disclosure Pressure Model (Bar-Hava, 2025) by introducing and empirically validating two complementary tools designed to capture the evolving dynamics of algorithm-aware corporate reporting. The first, the AI Orientation Score, measures the extent to which MD&A disclosures are structurally and linguistically aligned with formats favored by AI-based reading systems. The second, the AI Manipulation Exposure Index (AI-MEX), flags rhetorical patterns ,such as optimistic tone disconnected from performance, omission of key metrics, and vague aspirational language ,that may signal strategic impression management. Drawing on a standardized evaluation protocol applied across 80 MD&A sections from 20 leading S&P 100 firms between 2021 and 2024, the tools were implemented independently by two state-of-the-art language models, ChatGPT and Gemini. The results reveal a clear pattern: firms are increasingly tailoring their disclosures to meet the interpretive logic of algorithmic readers, and those with weaker fundamentals are more likely to exhibit narrative features associated with AI-MEX red flags. Although both models show broad agreement, differences in sensitivity ,especially regarding tone , highlight areas of rhetorical ambiguity that warrant closer scrutiny. Together, these tools provide a replicable and practical framework for assessing how companies craft disclosures in anticipation of algorithmic interpretation. By shedding light on emerging strategies in narrative design, this study contributes to ongoing debates around transparency, accountability, and the governance of financial communication in a landscape increasingly shaped by AI.

Keywords: AI Orientation, AI-MEX, Strategic Disclosure, Machine Readability, Narrative Manipulation
