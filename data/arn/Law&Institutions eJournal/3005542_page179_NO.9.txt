Abstract

This essay, written for the Conference on the New Special Study of Securities Markets at Columbia Law School, identifies the key regulatory challenges posed by institutional intermediaries in America’s capital markets. We survey existing legal and economic research and suggest new areas for regulatory reform and scholarly inquiry. We cover registered investment companies (such as mutual funds), private investment funds (such as hedge funds and private equity funds), credit-rating agencies, and broker-dealers.

Keywords: Institutional intermediaries, mutual funds, hedge funds, private equity funds, credit rating agencies, brokers, dealers

JEL Classification: G23, G24
