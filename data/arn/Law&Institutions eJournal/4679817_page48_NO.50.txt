Abstract

This paper investigates the empirical relation between CEO age and corporate digital transformation. Using a sample of Chinese listed firms from 2007 to 2022, we find that young CEOs exhibit a higher propensity to engage in digital transformation when compared to older CEOs. We pinpoint two key driving factors behind this phenomenon: CEOs’ motivation to establish a good reputation and their willingness to embrace failure. Furthermore, our heterogeneity tests show that the negative relation between CEO age and digital transformation does not vary with firms’ state ownership, but is more pronounced among firms with fewer financial constraints. Overall, our finding contributes to the growing body of literature examining how CEO characteristics influence digital transformation.

Keywords: Young CEOs; Corporate digital transformation; CEO reputation; Tolerance for failure
