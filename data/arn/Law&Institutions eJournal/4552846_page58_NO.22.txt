Abstract

How should firms best communicate their corporate social responsibility efforts? Across seven preregistered studies (N = 147,996; two large field studies and five online lab experiments), we find that framing donations as a series of periodic contributions (e.g., $1,000 per month for 12 months) rather than an equivalent aggregate amount (e.g., $12,000 this year) improves consumers’ perceptions of a donor company as well as engagement with that company. We show that periodic donations are effective because consumers view donation consistency as a diagnostic cue of donors’ commitment to the cause. Therefore, consumers view companies who frame donations periodically as more committed to the cause and worthy of charitable credit. Further, we identify a key boundary condition: when donations are very low in magnitude (e.g., $10 per month), periodic donations actually perform worse than aggregate donations, likely because small periodic amounts are judged as too low to signal commitment. Establishing this boundary condition allows us to reconcile the current findings with previously established research.

Keywords: prosocial behavior, corporate social responsibility, charitable credit, temporal framing, periodic pricing
