Abstract

Using the corporate social responsibility (CSR) report disclosure as an external shock on investors’ heterogeneous belief in China, we find that firms with environmental, social and governance (ESG) information disclosure have lower idiosyncratic risk than their counterparts. This finding is robust to the parallel-trend assumption, placebo test, PSM-DID design, and alternative idiosyncratic risk calculation. We conclude that CSR engagement could reduce firms’ idiosyncratic risk by providing additional nonfinancial information to reduce investors’ opinion divergence.

Keywords: CSR, ESG, Idiosyncratic risk, Heterogeneous belief, China
