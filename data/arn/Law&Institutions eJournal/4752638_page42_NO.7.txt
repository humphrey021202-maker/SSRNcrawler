Abstract

We investigate alignment of agile strategy and associated bottom-up decision making within non-holocracy organisations. The most common organizational form nowadays is the hierarchical organisation, in which decision are only taken by those who are ranked and dedicated positions. Start-up companies regarded as most innovative tend to converge while growing into hierarchical organisations form. However, there are also very successful companies which continue with agile and holocracy organizational structures. This paper investigates the linkage between agile decision making and organizational structure in large scale companies.
