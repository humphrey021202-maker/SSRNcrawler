Abstract

Objective: This study examines the impact of liquidity on the capital structure of firms listed on the Dubai Financial Market (DFM). It analyzes the influence of liquidity ratios, specifically the current ratio (CR) and quick ratio (QR), on leverage metrics over a thirteen-year period using a random-effects GLS regression analysis. Regression analysis was conducted using STATA version 12.

Results: Analysis reveals that QR was negatively associated with the debt/equity ratio, although the effect was not statistically significant (p > 0.1). Meanwhile, CR demonstrates a significantly negative association with leverage (β = -0.0418, p < 0.1), indicating that firms with higher liquidity tend to rely less on external debt. Moreover, a notable negative correlation was observed between CR and long-term debt levels (β = -0.004, p < 0.01). Liquidity ratios exhibit limited influence on the debt/asset ratio and short-term liabilities. These findings provide empirical evidence of how liquidity constraints influence capital structure strategies in emerging markets such as the UAE.

Conclusion: DFM-listed businesses may not prioritize QR in their capital structure decisions. CR has a stronger role in reducing long-term debt. Conservative views on long-term debt may indicate that firms seek financial flexibility in a changing environment. This study provides empirical contributions into the underexplored relationship between liquidity and capital structure in DFM-listed firms. The findings demonstrate how liquidity difficulties affect UAE enterprises' financing decisions.
