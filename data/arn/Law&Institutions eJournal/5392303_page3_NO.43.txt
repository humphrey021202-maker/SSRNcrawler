Abstract

This study examines the evolution, conceptual foundations, and strategic implications of global lease accounting reforms, focusing on Ind AS 116, IFRS 16, and US GAAP ASC 842. It addresses the limitations of previous standards-IAS 17, Ind AS 17, and ASC 840which enabled operating leases to remain off balance sheet, obscuring corporate leverage and impairing comparability. The main objectives are to trace the historical development of lease accounting from 2000 to 2024, compare current frameworks in recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure, and evaluate their financial and strategic impact on corporates, investors, and regulators. Methodologically, the article synthesizes standard-setting documents, regulatory guidance, academic literature, industry reports, and case examples from diverse sectors such as retail, aviation, and telecommunications. It incorporates both qualitative assessment and reference to empirical evidence on ratio effects, alongside perspectives from investors, credit rating agencies, and professional accounting firms. Findings indicate that all three frameworks now require recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for most leases, improving transparency and reducing opportunities for accounting-motivated structuring. IFRS 16 and Ind AS 116 apply a single-model approach for lessees, resulting in front-loaded expense patterns and EBITDA increases, whereas ASC 842 retains a dual model, preserving straight-line expense recognition for operating leases and creating cross-framework EBITDA differences. Lessor accounting remains largely unchanged across all regimes. The capitalization of leases significantly affects leverage ratios, return metrics, and operating profit measures, with pronounced impacts in asset-intensive industries. The study concludes that while the reforms enhance decision-usefulness, reduce information asymmetry, and align accounting with economic substance, differences in income statement treatment and certain disclosure requirements under IFRS/Ind AS versus US GAAP continue to challenge global comparability.
