Abstract

We show analysts at government-controlled brokerage firms serve as a market stabilization tool in China. Using earnings forecasts from 2005--2019, we find government-brokerage analysts issue relatively more optimistic---yet less accurate and timely---forecasts during market rescue periods, supporting stock prices. During market booms, they issue comparatively pessimistic but more accurate and timely forecasts, tempering excessive optimism. We show that these patterns are consistent with market stabilization incentives, and their impact is substantial: stocks with greater government-brokerage coverage experience higher liquidity during downturns but lower liquidity during hot markets, with corresponding post-earnings price adjustments. Our findings validate Brunnermeier, Sockin, and Xiong (RES 2022)'s theoretical predictions: state interventions can erode information efficiency under intensive intervention while maintaining it under a moderate level of intervention. Collectively, these results underscore that analysts can serve a dual role---as information providers and policy instruments shaping market expectations and stability---in a coordinated economy.

Keywords: Sell-side analysts, Market stabilization, Forecast optimism, Forecast accuracy, Government ownership, Coordinated economies
