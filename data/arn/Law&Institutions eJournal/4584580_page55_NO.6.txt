Abstract

I estimate a model of CEO compensation with non-binding shareholder approval votes (Say-on-Pay). The Board sets compensation and (relative to shareholders) may prefer high total pay; shareholders can fail the vote and punish the Board for high pay. Failed votes are perceived as costly by the Board and shareholders: Say-on-Pay resembles a costly punishment mechanism, raising firm value by 2.4% on average, despite only 7% of votes failing. I analyze a counterfactual binding vote: failure binds pay to prior levels, which may not reflect current information about CEO ability. The failure rate falls, pay levels increase and firm value decreases.

Keywords: shareholder voice, corporate governance, executive compensation, shareholder voting, say-on-pay, structural estimation, corporate finance, CEOs

JEL Classification: G30, G34
