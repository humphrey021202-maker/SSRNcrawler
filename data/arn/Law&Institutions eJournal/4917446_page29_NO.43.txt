Abstract

This study sought to identify the impact of artificial intelligence on improving the quality of internal auditing in commercial banks, with the moderating role of accounting information systems. The study utilized a descriptive and analytical approach to gather data. The data was collected through a random sample of administrative workers in Jordanian commercial banks, estimated at 246 employees. The statistical package for the social sciences program was used to examine the data after obtaining it using the questionnaire (SPSS). The results of the study showed that there is a statistically significant impact at the level (α≤0.05) of the moderating role of accounting information systems in the impact of artificial intelligence on improving the quality of internal auditing in commercial banks.

Keywords: artificial intelligence, Improving the Quality of Internal Auditing, Commercial Bank, Accounting Information Systems, Accounting Information
