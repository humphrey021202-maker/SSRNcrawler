Abstract

We relax Modigliani and Miller’s (1961) assumption of perfect capital markets for dividends by introducing a market imperfection that has not been investigated before, i.e., the economic uncertainty caused by infectious diseases. We exploit a unique text-based measure of infectious diseases that includes not only Covid-19, but also other important diseases, such as SARs MERs, and Ebola. Based on an immense sample of nearly 300,000 observations across four decades (from 1985 to 2021), our results show that a higher level of uncertainty induced by infectious diseases diminishes dividends significantly. Specifically, a rise in uncertainty by one standard deviation results in a decline in dividends by almost 2%. More independent directors on the board, however, mitigate the negative effect of infectious diseases on dividends, implying that the dividend cut in the presence of infectious diseases is partly motivated by agency conflicts. Infectious diseases are likely exogenous to firm-specific characteristics because they are beyond any company's control. As a result, our findings are unlikely tainted by endogeneity and probably reflect a causal influence rather than a mere association.

Keywords: infectious diseases, uncertainty, dividends, textual analysis, economic policy uncertainty.

JEL Classification: G32, D81
