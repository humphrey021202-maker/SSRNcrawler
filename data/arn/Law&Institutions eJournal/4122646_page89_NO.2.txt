Abstract

This paper exploits a natural experiment induced by a corporate governance reform in Brazil to estimate the effects of CEO non-duality on shareholder value. Three key findings emerge. First, regression discontinuity results suggest a positive market reaction to the reform among firms expected to separate the CEO and chairman roles. Second, instrumental variable and difference-in-differences estimates show that abnormal returns increase following the rupture, with dynamic analyses revealing a gradual and persistent rise. Third, after the splitting event, firms trade off external for internal financing and experience increases in investments and profits. The findings suggest these impacts stem from mitigating managerial agency issues and underscore that coercive rules may have distinct effects compared to recommendation-based regulations in contexts with weak shareholder protection institutions.

Keywords: CEO duality, mandatory regulation, shareholder value, financing policies.

JEL Classification: G32, G38, G41, O16
