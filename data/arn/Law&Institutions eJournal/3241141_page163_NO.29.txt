Abstract

This book encompasses theoretical and empirical analysis of takeovers and their relationship with society and the State in a rapidly changing social and commercial landscape. It assesses the experience of those affected by the process of law, for example employees who may find themselves disadvantaged by the operation of shareholder primacy during takeovers. Case studies on two formerly British companies (Corus Steel and Cadbury) which were taken over by foreign companies are also used.

Keywords: Takeover, Board Neutrality
