Abstract

Using the market values of audit partners' houses as a measure of their personal wealth, we find that wealthier U.S. partners provide higher-quality audits, as evidenced by fewer material restatements, fewer material SEC comment letters, and higher audit fees. A battery of falsification tests shows that these findings are not driven by the matching of wealthier partners with clients with higher financial reporting quality. Our additional analyses suggest two mechanisms underlying the positive association between partner wealth and audit quality: greater personal wealth both incentivizes partners to exert more effort in delivering high-quality audits and reveals partners' audit competence.

Keywords: individual partner, personal wealth, house value, audit quality

JEL Classification: M40, M42
