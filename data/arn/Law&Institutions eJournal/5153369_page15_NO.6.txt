Abstract

This paper examines Sri Lanka's current iscal and economic challenges through the lens of the 2025 national budget, analyzing the interplay between iscal policies, the banking sector, and governance reforms. The banking sector's pivotal role in revenue generation and fostering digital transformation is highlighted, with a focus on potential risks such as excessive taxation, which could sti le investment, and the cybersecurity and infrastructure gaps associated with digital payments. Additionally, the paper explores the iscal constraints imposed by public debt, corruption, and social welfare, arguing that iscal sustainability can only be achieved through comprehensive tax reforms, ef icient public expenditure, and strong anti-corruption measures. The analysis also assesses the ideological continuity in the government's economic approach, where despite claims of a shift toward economic democracy, policies remain largely aligned with previous center-left strategies. The paper concludes that Sri Lanka's economic recovery is contingent upon effective policy implementation, addressing systemic risks, and maintaining stability amidst an evolving governance landscape.
