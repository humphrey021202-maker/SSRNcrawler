Abstract

Investors and customers increasingly demand that corporations not only generate a high profit and return, but also improve the world around them. Whether it is through removing sweat shops from their supply chain, increasing safety standards for their employees, controlling gas emissions or reducing waste output. A CEO's performance is now judged not only on returns generated, but on the social performance of the firm. The purpose of this paper to assess whether “CSR Contracting” as it is now commonly known is truly effective in achieving its stated goal of improving a firm’s social performance. We find that after controlling for firm and industry effects, CSR compensation does markedly improve a firm’s overall social performance.

Keywords: CSR, Corporate Social Responsibility, CSR Contracting, Social Performance
