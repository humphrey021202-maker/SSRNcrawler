Combing total current liabilities and total LT_loan and comparing with total assets i.e. TD_TA rages from 0.47 to 0.72. ROA of the pharmaceuticals companies is not seen as satisfactory as the maximum ROA is just 8%. The result of regression shows that TD_TA = -0.500-0.500ROA + 1.889 FAIN_TA - 0.000CS + 0.000 LT_Loan + 0.000 Profit. The another model, ExeQ = -8,090,497.11 -1.34 Profit + 0.39 TA.
