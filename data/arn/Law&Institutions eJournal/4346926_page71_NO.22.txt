Abstract

This paper studies barriers to CEO succession at small- and medium-sized enterprises—personal guarantees on business loans. A personal guarantee is an individual's commitment to repay a loan if the business fails to repay. When incumbent CEOs take out loans with their personal guarantees, successors typically inherit their financial obligation, which can discourage potential successors from taking over the businesses for fear of financial risks. Using a Difference-in-Differences approach and exploiting a Japanese policy reform aimed at reducing the use of personal guarantees, we find that the reduction in loans with personal guarantees is associated with a higher succession likelihood. Furthermore, CEO succession results in a younger CEO age and improved firm performance, particularly when a substantial portion of loans with personal guarantees is eliminated.

Keywords: CEO, succession, small and medium-sized enterprise, personal guarantee, firm performance

JEL Classification: G21, G28, M51
