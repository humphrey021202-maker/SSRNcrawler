Abstract

The increasing global emphasis on sustainable development and mandated sustainable disclosure necessitates understanding their impact on capital markets and corporate behavior. This study employs a pre-registered economic experiment (N=140) to prospectively investigate how different disclosure systems – voluntary versus random (proxying for mandatory) – foster cooperative relationships between managers and investors towards a sustainable society. Utilizing a modified trust game with a disclosure option, the experiment analyzes managerial investment decisions in sustainable actions and investor allocation choices under both disclosure regimes. The findings reveal that while investors favor sustainable actions regardless of the disclosure system, voluntary disclosure does not elicit a premium and results in fewer sustainable managerial choices, suggesting potential bounded rationality and a “failure of selfish exchange.” This research contributes to the literature on the real effects of sustainable disclosure, highlighting potential benefits of mandatory regimes in fostering trust and sustainable actions.

Keywords: sustainable reporting, real effect, trust game, voluntary disclosure, mandated disclosure
