Abstract

This study explores the impact of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) practices on audit fees among Brazilian companies listed on B3 from 2018 to 2022. Using a linear regression model applied to panel data from 400 observations across 80 firms, the research investigates the distinct effects of each ESG dimension on audit costs. The findings reveal that robust environmental practices significantly reduce audit fees, supporting the hypothesis that strong environmental performance mitigates perceived audit risk. In contrast, social practices do not exhibit a substantial effect on audit costs, indicating that while they enhance corporate responsibility, they may not influence auditors' risk assessments. However, enhanced corporate governance is linked to higher audit fees, likely due to the increased complexity and thoroughness required in auditing companies with stringent governance frameworks. Additionally, the study confirms that traditional factors such as company size and affiliation with Big Four audit firms are significant determinants of audit fees. These insights offer practical guidance for managers and regulators, emphasizing the role of environmental sustainability in reducing audit costs while advocating for a balanced integration of governance and social responsibility policies.

Keywords: Audit Fees, ESG, Environmental Practices, Corporate Governance, Panel Data Analysis
