Abstract

By utilizing a global sample encapsulating 39 economies, I examine the impact of national-level antitrust regulations on corporate dividend policy. I document that firms raise cash distributions when severity of merger competition laws intensifies. This evidence is more significant for firms whose pre-established level of governance is weaker, or information asymmetry is greater. Consistent with paying dividends amidst competition reducing agency conflicts between management and equityholders, market share growth increases for firms paying dividends following heightened competition. These findings support that competition reveals managerial conduct, and helps produce an environment decreasing excess liquid assets that may disproportionately benefit self-serving management.

Keywords: Antitrust Regulations, Corporate Governance, Financing Policy, International Financial Markets, Payout Policy JEL Classification: G15, G32, G34, G35
