Abstract

The personal traits of CEOs have been found to influence financial reporting policies. We examine the impact of CEO past corporate distress experiences on accounting conservatism. CEOs who have experienced a corporate distress event in their career, while working in a non-CEO position at a different firm, subsequently adopt more conservative accounting policies once in the CEO position. Furthermore, past distress experiences related to restatements, SEC enforcement actions, or rating downgrades are particularly significant in influencing (future) CEO behavior. Overall, we report that professional experiences related to corporate distress affect financial reporting decisions, a novel finding in the literature.

Keywords: CEO experience; Accounting Conservatism; CEO Behavior; Behavioral Accounting; Risk-Taking

JEL Classification: M40, M41, M49, G40
