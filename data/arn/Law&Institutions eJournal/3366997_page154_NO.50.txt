Abstract

Businesses in developing countries face different challenges than those in economically developed countries. Markets and supply chains are less well-established. Dissemination of information is uneven. Because governmental infrastructure has limited ability to support business operations, businesses take on responsibilities that elsewhere are handled by a central government. This study reviews key elements of corporate governance. The study then reviews the banking and manufacturing sectors in Zimbabwe with attention to the presence or absence of financial infrastructure, legal infrastructure, market challenges, supply chain and government involvement to support corporate governance structures and systems. Recommendations for policy and practice changes are recommended. The present analysis of Zimbabwe can guide research on and policy recommendations for governance in other developing countries.

Keywords: Corporate Governance, Accountability, Developing Countries
