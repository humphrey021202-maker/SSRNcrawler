Abstract

This study examines how Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) enforcement actions against lenders’ borrowers shape lenders’ interactions with their EPA-targeted borrowers, other existing borrowers, and future borrowers. First, although non-exposed lenders aggressively tighten lending with EPA-targeted borrowers, exposed lenders appear to stabilize lending relationships with targeted borrowers by applying less credit rationing and smaller interest rate increases. Exposed lenders increase monitoring by requiring more environmental covenants in contracts with targeted borrowers, leading to more pronounced and persistent pollution reduction. Second, exposed lenders’ non-targeted borrowers significantly reduce pollution relative to borrowers of non-exposed lenders, and such spillover effects are stronger for lenders with greater monitoring incentives and influence. Exposed lenders tend to raise interest rates and terminate lending relationships with less responsive borrowers. Third, exposed lenders impose stricter loan terms on future borrowers, especially those in the same industry as targeted borrowers, resulting in lower pollution by future borrowers.

Keywords: EPA Enforcement, Private Lending, Lender-Borrower Interaction

JEL Classification: G21, G32, M41
