Abstract

Corporate Venture Capital (CVC) stands as a widely recognized financial investment strategy deployed to secure external funds and propel the advancement of enterprises. This article conducts a comprehensive visual analysis of the literature pertaining to Corporate Venture Capital (CVC) from 2014 to 2023 in the WOS and Scopus databases by utilizing CiteSpace and VOSviewer software. The objective is to discern resent research status, hotspots, and insights within the field by meticulously examining publication volume, authorship, keywords, clustering, and timeline maps. This literature review employs a meticulous selection criterion, totaling 168 articles being analyzed as samples. Firstly, bibliographic outcomes reveal a notable surge in the number of articles dedicated to CVC in recent years, indicating a burgeoning interest in this domain. However, there is a discernible opportunity for increased collaboration among authors and countries, as a select cadre of core researchers, notably including Dushnitksy, appears to wield substantial influence in shaping CVC research. Secondly, an in-depth literature review and discussion, incorporating keyword and clustering analyses alongside a timeline examination, elucidates three distinct research themes within the domain of Corporate Venture Capital (CVC). These encompass a scrutiny of the comparative characteristics between CVC and Independent Venture Capital (IVC), an exploration of the theoretical frameworks that underscore CVC's attractiveness to investors, and an investigation into the subsequent impact and performance of CVC. Finally, by identifying the existing three primary research topics, prospect research directions are elaborated.

Keywords: CVC, Corporate Venture Capital, Investment, Systematic literature review, CiteSpace, VOSviewer
