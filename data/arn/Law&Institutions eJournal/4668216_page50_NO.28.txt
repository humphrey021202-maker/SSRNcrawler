Abstract

There has been substantial hype about the use of blockchain for supply chain and trade finance, proclaiming that it would “change the world.” Although during 2016-2018 blockchain was riding high on the hype curve, in 2019 it fell into the trough of disillusionment. Along the way, some consultants have recently stopped promoting blockchain and attention appears have shifted away from enterprise blockchain systems. As a result, it probably is not surprising that recently there have been several instances where those enterprise blockchain efforts went insolvent or were shutdown. This paper investigates those blockchain systems and identifies some of the potential factors affecting the success of those systems. We also provide some potential approaches to mitigate the limitations of those applications.

Keywords: Blockchain, Enterprise, Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem, Gartner’s Hype Cycle, Platform Entrepreneurs, Blockchain Best Practices

JEL Classification: L00, L26, L86, L89, M
