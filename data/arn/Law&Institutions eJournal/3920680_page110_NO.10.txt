Abstract

This study constructs a measure of face-to-face private communication between managers and sell-side analysts by mapping New York City (NYC) taxi trip records to company headquarters and brokerage locations of NYC analysts. We show that taxi trips increase around earnings announcement dates (EAD), reflecting heightened demand for private communication. The increase in post-EAD rides is associated with both analyst- and firm-level consequences. At the analyst-level, post-EAD ride increases are associated with more accurate and timely earnings forecasts, more profitable stock recommendations, and forecast revisions that elicit stronger market reactions without subsequent drift. At the firm level, companies with greater post-EAD taxi activity by forecast-issuing analysts exhibit stock prices more reflective of future earnings and larger reductions in forecast dispersion and bid-ask spreads. Overall, the findings suggest that post-EAD private communications help analysts to produce timely and precise public signals about firms’ future earnings that markets price efficiently.

Keywords: Private Communications, Sell-Side Analysts, Taxis, Earnings Forecasts, Stock Recommendations, Reg FD
