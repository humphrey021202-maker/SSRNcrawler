Abstract

This study examines the stock market reaction to institutional investors’ pre-disclosure of voting positions. Specifically, we investigate price reactions to voting intentions publicly disclosed by Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), the asset manager of the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund, ahead of its portfolio firms’ annual general meetings. We classify a voting intention as “dissent” when it opposes management’s vote recommendation on a proxy proposal. We find positive abnormal returns around announcements of dissent for proposals that later pass or fail by a narrow margin. These results are concentrated in firms with weaker corporate governance, poorer past performance, or greater NBIM influence, and in proposals concerning board independence or capital structure. We explore two mechanisms that may explain the market reaction: a prediction channel, where NBIM’s dissent affects voting outcomes, and a certification channel, where dissent signals value-enhancing shareholder monitoring. We find no evidence that dissent increases the likelihood of a proposal passing in line with NBIM’s position. Instead, our results support the certification channel: NBIM is more likely to engage with firms where it dissents, suggesting that investors perceive dissent as a credible signal of increased monitoring. Overall, our findings show that voting intention disclosures by a large universal investor are value-relevant, providing implications for the debate on increasing transparency of institutional investors’ proxy voting, particularly through pre-declaration of votes.
