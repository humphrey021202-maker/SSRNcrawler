Abstract

We study the effect of expected regulatory costs from new antitrust laws on firms’ conditional conservatism. To draw plausibly causal inferences, we exploit changes in the stringency of antitrust laws in 82 countries and regions from 1991 to 2010. When antitrust laws become more stringent, we expect firms with high market power to increase conservatism to reduce their reported earnings, which decreases pressures from antitrust regulators and the expected regulatory costs. We find evidence consistent with our prediction. We also find that the positive stringency-conservatism association is stronger when enforcement is stronger. The positive association is also stronger when firms experience increases in market power, suggesting that firms expect such increases to attract regulators’ attention and, hence, they report more conservatively. Our results are robust to alternative sample compositions, conservatism models, antitrust indices, industry classifications, and several identification assumption tests.

Keywords: antitrust laws, regulatory costs, conditional conservatism, competition laws, competition, investment

JEL Classification: D43, G34, L4, L40, K21, M41
