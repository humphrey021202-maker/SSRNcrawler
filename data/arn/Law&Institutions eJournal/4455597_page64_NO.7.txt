Private Equity Exits after IPOs

Abstract

We examine exits of private equity sponsors after IPOs of portfolio firms via follow-on secondary equity offerings and third party takeovers. Sponsors retain major ownership in listed portfolio firms for lengthy periods after IPOs, well beyond lockup expiration. After private equity post-IPO secondary offerings, corporate profitability is strongly superior to benchmarks, so firms are successfully prepared for private equity’s subsequent exit. Nevertheless, share prices fall at offering announcements, reflecting the failure of private equity sponsors to exit their stakes in listed entities at high premiums paid in third party takeovers, premiums that are invariably shared pro rata with public shareholders.

Keywords: Private equity, secondary offerings, third party takeover

JEL Classification: G34
