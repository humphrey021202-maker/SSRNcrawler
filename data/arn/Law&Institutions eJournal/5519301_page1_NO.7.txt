Abstract

This study examines the relationship between environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance and financial performance in China's machinery manufacturing sector. Using a panel dataset of 1,799 firm-year observations from 180 A-and H-share listed companies between 2014 and 2023, we employ firm-and year-fixed effects OLS regression models to control for unobserved heterogeneity. Our findings indicate that a one-point increase in ESG score leads to a 0.12 percentage point rise in return on assets (ROA), a 0.24 percentage point increase in return on equity (ROE), and a 0.33-unit improvement in Tobin's q-equivalent to a 13% market revaluation. Furthermore, we find that firm size amplifies the positive effect of ESG on market valuation but not on profitability measures. These results underscore ESG as a material value driver rather than a compliance exercise, offering practical insights for managers, investors, and policymakers seeking to align sustainability goals with financial outcomes.

Keywords: ESG Performance, Financial Performance, Tobin’s Q, Machinery Manufacturing, China, Dual-Carbon Goals, Sustainability, Resource-Based View, Stakeholder Theory
