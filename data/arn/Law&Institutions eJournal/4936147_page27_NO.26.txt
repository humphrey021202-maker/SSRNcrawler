Abstract

Prior research found voluntary forecasts by managers of distressed firms to be biased, less truthful, and viewed as less credible by market participants. We study mandatory disclosure of management forecasts using a unique setting, where financially distressed firms with publicly traded debt must disclose cash-flow forecasts. We estimate the bond price reaction to mandatory cash flow forecasts in treated vs. non-treated matched firms and find that bond investors perceive mandatory cash flow forecasts as credible and informative. These results are robust to different specifications of the matching procedure, including first time cash flow forecasts and the inclusion of various fixed effects. Further, a naïve model forecast does not generate any bond reaction, indicating management forecasts convey unique, valuable information. Finally, we document favorable economic consequences where disclosing firms that went through reorganization exhibited significantly higher recovery rates relative to reorganizations without such disclosure.
