Abstract

Antitrust regulations in banking have historically targeted commercial banking activities. Does the consolidation of investment banks have competitive effects? Using the geographically fragmented municipal bond underwriting market as a natural laboratory and employing a stacked difference-in-differences specification, I find that the underwriting spread increases by 4.8% of its sample mean following within-market consolidation. The effects double for larger M&As or in more concentrated markets and do not dissipate over time. These M&As do not generate efficiency gains that manifest as lower bond yields or substitution of other issuer-paid services. The findings remain robust when examining M&As less prone to endogeneity concerns and are absent in several placebo tests. Further, Census data suggest that such consolidation is followed by higher financing costs and reduced new issuance. My findings offer a novel perspective on bank antitrust regulations, which are currently in the spotlight for revision and modernization.
