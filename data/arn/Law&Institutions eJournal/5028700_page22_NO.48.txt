Abstract

DAC8 could be a quick fix to cryptocurrency tax evasion. In an ecosystem where pseudo-anonymity is the rule, however, taxpayers are difficult to identify. Unless information can be obtained that links the virtual and real identities of taxpayers, taxation is impossible and even the best thought-out tax rules will be limited in scope. This article, after establishing the cryptocurrency playing field, addresses the limitations of cryptocurrency tax compliance, with an emphasis on the European Union.
