Abstract

Prior theoretical studies on agency problems hold different opinions against empirical works on two questions: (i). Are CEOs incentivized to shelter good information? (ii). Are CEOs incentivized to evenly shelter firms’ good and bad information? This paper answers these questions by demonstrating that CEOs with high pay-performance incentives tend to successfully shelter good information rather than the bad one from investors. Furthermore, we find that those CEOs with high equity incentives shelter good information by using real earnings management but not accrual-based earnings management. This one-sided information manipulation decreases their firms’ exposure to both stock lottery-like behavior and rare disasters.

Keywords: J33, G34

JEL Classification: CEO Delta incentive, Good Information Manipulation, Real Earnings Management
