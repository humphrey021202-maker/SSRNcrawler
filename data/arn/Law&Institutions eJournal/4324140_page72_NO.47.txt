Abstract

We find a significantly negative correlation between CEOs possessing government work experience (GWE) and their firms' likelihood of regulatory noncompliance, focusing on safetyrelated violations. Additional tests reveal 1) this relationship holds for severe violations, 2) the auditors of firms with GWE CEOs are less likely to report ineffective regulatory compliance issues, and 3) GWE decreases violation incidence, but increases the likelihood of violation detection. These findings suggest that CEOs with GWE prioritize and/or understand regulatory compliance better, rather than leveraging connections with regulators to evade monitoring. The negative association is stronger for CEOs with recent GWE and direct experience working for federal agencies, and in more complex firms, while weaker in larger firms and unionized industries. CEOs with GWE also mitigate the negative effects of regulatory violations on stock returns, enjoy longer tenures and experience fewer turnovers, highlighting the value of GWE to firms.
