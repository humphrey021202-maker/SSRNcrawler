Abstract

Mandatory disclosure burdens initially suppress the investment of newly public firms, but as firms become more seasoned, this relation attenuates, becoming insignificant four years after a firm's initial public offering (IPO). Consistent with the mandatory disclosure-investment relation being rooted in information frictions leading firms to focus on short-term metrics at the expense of long-term investments, this life cycle effect (1) coincides with a substantial drop in measures of information asymmetry, (2) concentrates in R&D investment, and (3) is strongest for young IPO firms and firms that continue expanding their public float most after they go public.

Keywords: Corporate Investment, Mandatory Disclosure, JOBS Act, Initial Public Offering (IPO), Smaller Reporting Company (SRC), Life Cycle Effects
