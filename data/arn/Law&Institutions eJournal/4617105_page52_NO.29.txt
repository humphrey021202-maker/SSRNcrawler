Abstract

This thesis provides a comprehensive examination of how risk-taking behaviors, corporate sustainability, and corporate governance mechanisms interact to shape firms' risk management approaches. It comprises three interrelated papers investigating different dimensions of corporate risk taking.

The first paper investigates the causal effect of CEO career concerns on general corporate risk aversion. Using a regression discontinuity design (RDD), it demonstrates that missing performance evaluation targets increases CEO career concerns, making CEOs more risk-averse. Specifically, heightened career concerns lead CEOs to favor safer corporate policies including lower capital expenditures, higher cash reserves, and increased dividend payouts. This effect is stronger for newer CEOs and those with a greater proportion of deferred compensation. The paper makes two key contributions. First, it establishes a systematic empirical measurement of corporate risk across profit volatility, stock return volatility, and corporate investment policies. Second, it delineates a causal mechanism from missing performance targets to heightened career concerns and ultimately greater risk aversion. By overcoming endogeneity concerns, it shows career concerns directly impact CEO risk preferences and corporate policies.

The second paper builds on the first by examining the causal effect of career concerns on ESG reputational risk management. Applying the same RDD methodology, it demonstrates that missing performance targets incentivizes CEOs to protect their reputation by reducing exposures to ESG controversies. However, this superficial reputation management comes at the expense of actual improvements in ESG performance. The paper introduces a novel firm-level ESG controversies database to distinguish reputational risk management from substantive ESG engagement. It shows CEOs prioritize immediate ESG reputation protection over long-term ESG performance commitments when facing career concerns. This paper delineates how implicit incentives shape CEOs' trade-offs between reputation management and actual performance.

The third paper analyzes how director nomination eligibility criteria (DNEC) affect stock price crash risk. Leveraging unique hand-collected data from China, it reveals that higher DNEC reduces crash risk by altering board composition and transparency. Using two novel instrumental variables, it establishes a causal link between higher DNEC and lower crash risk. Further tests show this effect is amplified in non-state-owned firms with less executive control, higher stock price volatility, and more retail investors. This paper demonstrates how a specific governance mechanism—DNEC—can mitigate the detrimental effects of short-term institutional investors.

Together, the three papers illustrate the critical roles of formal governance policies and implicit managerial incentives in influencing corporate risk-taking behaviors. Utilizing quasi-experimental RDD and instrumental variables, the papers establish causality through empirical tests. The thesis makes theoretical and empirical contributions to finance literature, while also offering practical insights into corporate risk management and investment risk identification for executives, policymakers, and regulators.
