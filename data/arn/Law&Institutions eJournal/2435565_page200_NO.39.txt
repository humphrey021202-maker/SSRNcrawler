Abstract

A good number of theoretical and empirical researches on social and environmental responsibility disclosure have been undertaken throughout the globe due to the continuing emphasis on green awareness. But most of the CSR studies conducted so far have been in the context of developed countries. CSR is an emerging concept in Bangladesh and very few studies are available here. In this study, an empirical investigation is made on the Corporate Social Disclosure (CSD) practiced by 20 randomly selected banking companies listed with Dhaka Stock exchange in 2008. To facilitate the analysis, a Corporate Social Disclosure Index (CSDI) has been computed by considering 15 disclosure items.

Keywords: Corporate social disclosure, corporate social responsibility, voluntary disclosure
