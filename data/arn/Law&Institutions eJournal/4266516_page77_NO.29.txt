Abstract

Utilizing a CEO fixed-effects approach, we find that latent managerial characteristics account for a substantial portion of firm-level variation in ESG outcomes. Our analysis shows that a CEO’s work experience at a not-for-profit (NFP) organization is strongly correlated with these fixed effects and is associated with superior ESG performance. Notably, one in three S&P 1500 companies is now led by a CEO with NFP experience, reflecting a four-fold increase over the past two decades. Our findings highlight the evolving characteristics of top managers in response to the growing prominence of ESG.

Keywords: Chief Executive Officer, Managerial Style, Green Innovation, Pollution, Employee Satisfaction, Non-profit Organization
