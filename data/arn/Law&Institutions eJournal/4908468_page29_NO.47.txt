Abstract

This study clarifies the relationship between variable costing and overproduction. Full costing is problematic since it promotes overproduction by positively evaluating inventory increases. In contrast, variable costing is recognized as a method that solves this problem. Although many studies examine the overproduction caused by full costing, none sufficiently clarify whether variable costing restrains overproduction. This study clarified this relationship using data from a mail questionnaire survey of Japanese manufacturing firms, approximately half of which use variable costing, and archival data. Results reveal that the implementation of variable costing is negatively related to overproduction and the incentive payments of divisional managers strengthen this relationship. Accordingly, the use of variable costing, in addition to full costing, is effective for management accounting purposes. This finding provides important evidence for the long-standing debate on variable versus full costing.

Keywords: variable (direct) costing, full (absorption) costing, overproduction, real earnings management, cost accounting
