Abstract

This paper is the first one that uses a panel data of different types of shareholder protection in order to examine (i) the effect of such laws on stock market development and (ii) the convergence of shareholder protection laws through cross-border mergers and acquisitions. We find significant results for enabling laws but less so for paternalistic ones.

Keywords: law and finance, shareholder protection, corporate governance, corporate finance

JEL Classification: G32, K22, N20, O16, P50
