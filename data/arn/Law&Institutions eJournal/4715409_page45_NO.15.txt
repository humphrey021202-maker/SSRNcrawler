Abstract

What do we know about investment fraud? This work expands the body of knowledge through several means. This paper discerns whether Americans can successfully identify investment fraud and under which conditions. Drawing on the work of Kircanski et al. (2018), I investigated whether American adults could discern fraud within their brokerage statements. I found that older persons were 2% more likely to produce a false negative when ascertaining investment fraud while those who were married (not single or partnered) or better educated were 59% and 13% more likely, respectively, to produce a false positive. This study poses important questions and implications for a plethora of stakeholders, including researchers, practitioners, customers, policymakers, and regulators.

Keywords: investment fraud, fraud identification, fraud reporting, MTurk
