Abstract

We propose a new measure of firm-level climate regulatory exposure based on 10-K filings. Using the 2016 Trump election as an exogenous shock to perceived climate regulatory risks, we identify a positive effect on stock returns for firms with higher climate regulatory exposures; they experience economically and statistically significant higher cumulative returns post-election. In the year following the election, firms with higher climate regulatory exposure experience higher carbon emissions and lower investor attention. Both findings indicate that, post-election, investors become less concerned with climate regulatory risks. Results are robust to physical climate, trade, tax and oil price exposures.

Keywords: Climate regulatory exposure, textual analysis, Trump election, stock returns.

JEL Classification: G14, G18, G38.
