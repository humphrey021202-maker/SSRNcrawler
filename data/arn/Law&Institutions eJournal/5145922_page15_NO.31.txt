Abstract

This paper examines how constraints on workforce adjustment influence firms' choice between relationship-based and arms-length debt financing. Exploiting quasi-experimental variation from the staggered adoption of state-level Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Acts, we find that increased labor adjustment constraints lead firms to significantly increase their reliance on bank debt relative to public debt. Additional analysis reveals significant improvements in employee treatment following adoption, suggesting firms optimize across multiple dimensions of workforce management when termination flexibility decreases. The above evidence implies that when increased labor adjustment constraints enable workers gain relative bargaining power, firms respond through strategic financing choices that can ease renegotiation, which helps enhance employee treatment and elicit greater effort. Our findings have important implications on how labor market frictions shape the relative constraints and benefits of relationship-based financing.

Keywords: Labor adjustment constraints, Debt structure, Financial contracting, Employment protection, Employee treatment JEL Classifications: G32
