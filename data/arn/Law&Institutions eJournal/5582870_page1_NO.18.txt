Abstract

This paper examines how generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) can enhance qualitative research and explores its implications for internal auditing. Using transcripts from a two-day discussion with 15 senior auditors from multinational corporations, we compare traditional manual analysis with GenAI-assisted approaches. We find that GenAI meaningfully reduces effort in anonymization and initial coding, improves transparency, and provides structured prompts that accelerate analysis, though it requires ongoing human validation to capture nuance and context. In the internal audit domain, participants view GenAI as a “co-pilot” that increases efficiency in report writing, document analysis, and risk identification, while also supporting junior auditors’ learning. However, concerns around data security, trust, organizational resistance, and the need to preserve professional judgment limit adoption. Our study demonstrates how GenAI can both strengthen qualitative research practices and reshape internal auditing, highlighting its potential to increase efficiency and insight while raising critical governance and implementation challenges.
