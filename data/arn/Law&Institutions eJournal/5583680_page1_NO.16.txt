Abstract

This study investigates how political uncertainty influences firms’ earnings management activities. Using Thai equity markets as a natural experiment, it examines two major institutional shocks, the 2006 and 2014 military coups, and estimates their implications for firms’ financial reporting strategies. Using a difference-in-differences design, it considers Thai firms as a treatment group with a matched control sample from Indonesia, South Korea, and the Philippines that are countries sharing similar institutional characteristics but which were otherwise unaffected by comparable political disruptions during the same period. The study explores two types of earnings management: accrual-based and real activities-based. Our main findings suggest that firms have consistently reduced reported earnings through accruals following both coups, indicating a shift toward more conservative accounting during political instability. In contrast, real earnings management have been used to increase earnings after each coup, with a more immediate and persistent pattern observed following the 2014 event. Our results indicate that, in the face of regime instability and institutional risk, managers adopt more conservative financial reporting as a strategic response to increased scrutiny and uncertainty.

Keywords: Financial Reporting Quality, Political Uncertainty, Coup, accrual earnings management, real earnings management
