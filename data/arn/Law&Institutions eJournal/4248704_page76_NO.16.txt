Abstract

I examine if the firms in the same industry make similar decisions when they share large institutional owners. This relationship is important given the tremendous rise of common institutional owners and their significance on their portfolio firms’ policies. I hypothesize that common institutional owners cause rival firms to make similar decisions by creating anticompetitive incentives, reducing information asymmetry, and exercising an influence on governance. Using the Gravity model, I find that higher common institutional ownership causes rival firms to behave similarly. I do not find a relationship when the rival firms do not share any common owners. My study uses a quasi-natural experiment of institutional investor mergers and inclusion into S&P 500 index that generates a positive exogenous shock on common institutional ownership. My findings are robust to a battery of model specifications.

Keywords: Common institutional ownership, investment policies, financial policies
