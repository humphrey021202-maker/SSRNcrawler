Abstract

Drawing on the signalling theory, we argue that a firm’s public-private strategic alliances improve the likelihood for forming subsequent private-private strategic alliances. We complement prior research on the formation of strategic alliances by suggesting that a firm’s public-private strategic alliances represent an important signal about its reliability to potential partners, which in turn increases its opportunities of forming private-private strategic alliances. We further posit that this signalling effect will be enhanced for firms with strong technological capabilities. Based on an analysis of data obtained by World Bank from 851 Chinese manufacturing firms across five industries during the period of 2000-2002, we find support for our key predictions.

Keywords: Strategic alliances, private-private alliances, private-public alliances, signalling, technological capabilities, emerging markets, China
