Abstract

We introduce buyback guidance as a novel voluntary disclosure and examine why some repurchasing firms (“guiders”) publicly disclose repurchase forecasts while others (“non-guiders”) remain silent. Our empirical evidence shows that buyback guidance helps mitigate agency problems associated with excess cash by credibly signaling a commitment to sustained capital return. First, guidance enhances valuation for mature, cash-rich firms that benefit from steady payouts: guiders experience higher announcement returns, stronger long-horizon associations between returns and repurchases, and more negative reactions when they suspend guidance. Second, guiders repurchase more consistently and in greater amounts, with buybacks more closely tracking improvements in operating performance. Combined with the finding that guidance tends to serve as a lower bound rather than a precise target, this pattern suggests guiders commit to the disclosed amount while retaining upward flexibility, further mitigating agency costs by matching outflows of cash to inflows of cash. Third, this credible commitment comes at a cost: guiders pay 1–5% more for their repurchased shares than non-guiders, consistent with reduced flexibility to time the market. Taken together, our results suggest that the decision to issue buyback guidance evolves endogenously with firms’ repurchase policies and underlying payout motives.
