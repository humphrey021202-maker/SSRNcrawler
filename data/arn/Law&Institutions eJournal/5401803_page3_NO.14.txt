Abstract

Critical audit matters (CAMs) were introduced to enhance transparency in public company audits by providing engagement-specific insight into auditor judgments, yet early evidence shows many CAMs are highly standardized. Proprietary cost theory predicts that managers seek to limit transparency when disclosure risks revealing strategically sensitive information. We examine whether such concerns influence auditors' CAM reporting and find that clients with greater proprietary cost concerns receive CAMs that more closely conform to those of industry peers, according to both textual and categorical measures. Additionally, audit partners whose CAM reports deviate from industry norms experience a higher likelihood of voluntary turnover. Overall, our study reveals that client proprietary cost concerns extend beyond managerial disclosure decisions to influence auditors' communication, which may preclude the intended transparency benefits of expanded audit reporting.
