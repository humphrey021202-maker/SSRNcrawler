Abstract

This study investigates the impact of Logistics Performance Index (LPI) indicators on the overall LPI score through comprehensive statistical analyses, including regression and factor analysis, using data from the World Bank. The study covers 105 countries from 2007 to 2023, focusing on six key indicators: customs clearance efficiency, quality of trade transport-related infrastructure, ease of arranging competitively priced shipments, logistics service competence, shipment tracking and tracing ability, and timeliness. These indicators serve as independent variables, while the overall LPI score is the dependent variable. The findings reveal that the most influential factor is logistics service competence, followed by infrastructure quality and tracking and tracing capabilities. Customs clearance efficiency, ease of arranging competitively priced shipments, and timeliness also play crucial roles, though to a lesser extent. The analysis highlights that logistics competence significantly drives improvements in global logistics performance. Moreover, the study reveals regional variations in indicator impacts. Europe and Asia exhibit higher sensitivity to logistics competence and infrastructure, while Africa and South America demonstrate relatively lower but still significant responses. Factor analysis identifies three core dimensions influencing logistics performance: logistics efficiency, infrastructure and customs, and international shipments and tracking. This study underscores the necessity for tailored strategies to enhance logistics performance, emphasizing the prioritization of logistics competence and infrastructure development. Policymakers and businesses are encouraged to adopt targeted investments, streamline customs procedures, enhance tracking technologies, and improve international shipment processes to boost their global LPI rankings and strengthen economic competitiveness. These findings provide valuable insights for developing actionable logistics improvement frameworks on a national and international scale.
