Abstract

We examine the characteristics of Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs) focused on green causes. The growing importance of SPACs in financial markets has led to an increased presence of entrepreneurs raising capital to fund environmently friendly companies. We examine the structural characteristics of ‘green SPACs’: explaining their ecosystem, documenting the primary determinants of IPO size, speed of going public, and calculating their returns around merger announcements. Regarding green SPAC size, we find that the amount of capital raised depends on geographical focus, CEO characteristics, choice of exchange, and specialization of respective legal counsels. The speed to IPO is related to respective geographical and legal-counsel characteristics. At the same time, green SPACs exhibit cumulative market-adjusted returns in the range of 6% to 12% around merger announcement. Further, while merger returns are positive at merger date, they quickly become negative (-1 to -9%) declining further with time.

Keywords: Blank checks, Green Finance, ESG, Initial public offering, SPACs, Special purpose acquisition company
