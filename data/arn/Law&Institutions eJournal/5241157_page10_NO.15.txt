Abstract

This study examines how dividend policies shape shareholder wealth in Nigerian listed companies amid intersecting challenges of economic volatility, regulatory constraints, and cultural expectations. Employing a mixed-methods approach, we analyze financial data from 50 Nigerian Stock Exchange-listed firms (2015-2023)-stratified across banking, manufacturing, and telecom sectors-and qualitative insights from semi-structured interviews with 15 CFOs and institutional investors. Key findings reveal that consistent dividend payouts drive shareholder returns (18% higher annualized returns for stable payers; β = 0.41, p < 0.01 in banking), yet macroeconomic instability-particularly forex scarcity (β =-0.73, p< 0.01) and inflation averaging 15.4%erodes real value. Regulatory compliance (e.g., CAM Act profit mandates) and cultural norms for high payouts dominate firm-level decisions, often overriding profitability. The study advances a 'Volatility-Adaptive Dividend Framework', proposing hybrid models (e.g., forex-linked payouts reducing stock volatility by 22%) and ESG-aligned strategies (e.g., Dangote Cement's 5% community reinvestment, boosting satisfaction scores by 18 points) to balance liquidity needs and investor expectations. By contextualizing signaling and agency theories to Nigeria's institutional realities-including weak governance in family firms and retail investor dominance-this research offers actionable strategies: firms should adopt dynamic payout triggers, policymakers must prioritize forex access reforms, and investors ought to discount nominal growth during hyperinflation. While limited by self-reported data, the findings advocate for comparative African studies (e.g., Kenya, South Africa) and digital currency solutions to address forex constraints. The study concludes that adaptive, context-sensitive policies are indispensable for shareholder value creation in frontier markets, challenging one-size-fits-all dividend paradigms.
