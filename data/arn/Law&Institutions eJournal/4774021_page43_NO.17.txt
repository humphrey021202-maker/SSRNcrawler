Abstract

This study investigates whether director qualifications affect acquisition decisions. By analysing a sample of 14,052 United States (US) acquisitions, we find that acquirers with more qualified board members achieve higher market valuations during the announcement period of acquisitions. They also display efficiency improvements as reflected by lower premiums paid to targets, shorter time taken to complete the deal and greater probability of completing initiated deals. These acquirers also report significant improvements in their long-run financial and operating performance.

Keywords: Director qualifications, Acquisitions, Qualification Index, Abnormal Return, Acquisition Efficiency
