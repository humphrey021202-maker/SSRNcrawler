Abstract

We evaluate changes in system-wide information transmission following US and European bank M&A. We generalize Granger causality network measures to consider spillover channels in the mean, volatility, and tail risk, each capturing a unique form of systemic risk transmission between acquirers and the system. We exploit our measure's directionality and granularity to offer novel results on the exact transmission channels within and across regions, and extend research to include bank-nonbank deals. Following M&A, US acquirers contribute more to local tail risk and become more vulnerable to local and cross-border shocks, while European acquirers increase US tail risk. Our findings also highlight the benefits of scale, diversification, and the negative externalities linked to pre-merger systemic relevance.
