Abstract

Theory suggests that relatively inefficient firms should have lower and more uncertain future cash flows, which should lead to lower current equity values and higher future equity returns. However, the literature provides contradictory evidence on the relationship between operational efficiency and future stock performance. We provide evidence that investors are not fully aware of firms’ operational inefficiencies and are negatively surprised when future negative earnings are announced, resulting in a significant negative drift in returns for these firms. Furthermore, we provide evidence that analysts do not properly incorporate information about operational inefficiency into their earnings forecasts and target prices, and do not seem to care about the issue during conference calls.

Keywords: Operational Efficiency; Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA); Conference Calls; Analysts Forecasts; Delayed Market Reaction

JEL Classification: M41
