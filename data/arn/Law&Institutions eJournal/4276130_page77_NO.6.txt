Abstract

This paper studies whether banks actively monitor misreporting in unaudited financial statements. For identification, we focus on misreporting of debt. We measure debt misreporting by comparing balance sheet amounts with public credit registry data. We find that firms with financial needs underreport –rather than overreport– debt obligations. Banks appear to play a significant role in monitoring such misreporting; underreporting firms obtain significantly less credit when the bank has previous exposure to this accounting issue and when the bank verifies debt information using the public credit registry. Consistently, we observe that debt misreporting does not persist beyond two periods and that misreporting firms delay payments to suppliers and end up defaulting on their payment commitments with banks. 

Keywords: enforcement of financial reporting, debt underreporting, financial distress, credit registries, unaudited private firms

JEL Classification: G21, M41
