Abstract

In this paper I argue that through the research summarized in this short article, substantial progress has been made in overcoming three fundamental barriers to the adoption of multiple corporate objectives, thereby to enable managing and accounting for multiple stakeholders. These three fundamental barriers are: (1) that top managers cannot be conceptualized philosophically as multiple-objective decision makers; (2) that there is no decision making mechanism to support multi-objective decision making by managers; and (3) that even if the first two barriers could be cleared, it appears not to be possible to account for the interests of stakeholders who are outside the corporate entity.

Keywords: stakeholder, stakeholder management, strategic management
