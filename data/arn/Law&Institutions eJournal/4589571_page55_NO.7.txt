Abstract

The emergence of chatbots, notably advanced models like ChatGPT, has ushered in a paradigm shift across an array of industries, encompassing finance, customer service, and education. This research endeavors to meticulously investigate the ramifications of these chatbots on the realm of Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) compliance, a foundational U.S. federal law instrumental in enforcing rigorous reforms to enhance the accuracy and transparency of financial disclosures within corporations. Our study is poised to unveil the multifaceted facets of integrating chatbots into the tapestry of SOX compliance processes. In an era defined by relentless technological innovation, businesses are increasingly turning to artificial intelligence-driven conversational agents as potential catalysts for streamlining compliance efforts. This inquiry is geared towards dissecting the potential advantages that such integration might yield, while also taking a critical look at the attendant challenges and broader implications. By scrutinizing the intricate interplay between advanced chatbots and SOX compliance, we aim to contribute substantive insights to the ongoing discourse surrounding the evolving dynamics of regulatory adherence in corporate environments.

Keywords: Chatbots, ChatGPT, Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) compliance, regulatory reforms, financial disclosures, artificial intelligence, corporate governance, automation, regulatory impact.
