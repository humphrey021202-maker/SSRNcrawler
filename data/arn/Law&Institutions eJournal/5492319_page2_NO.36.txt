Abstract

This study investigates the impact of the “pre-decision deliberation” mechanism—an institutional innovation that integrates Party organizations into corporate governance—on cost stickiness in Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Employing a quasi-natural experiment and a difference-in-differences (DiD) approach with A-share listed firms from 2012 to 2022, we find that embedding Party organizations significantly reduces cost stickiness. The mechanism mitigates dual-agency problems and moderates overconfident decision-making, thereby enhancing cost management efficiency. These findings advance the understanding of political governance’s role in shaping firm-level cost behavior and provide actionable insights for policymakers and enterprise leaders seeking to enhance SOE governance and promote high-quality development. Overall, our results highlight the value of collective decision-making and robust oversight in restraining opportunistic behaviors and improving resource allocation within SOEs.

Keywords: Cost stickiness, State-owned enterprises, Party organization, Corporate governance
