Abstract

The aim of this paper is to measure the degree of mandatory corporate governance disclosure and examine its impact on the bank’s growth using annual data for listed banks on the UAE financial markets during the period 2003-2013. Our empirical results show that the degree of mandatory corporate governance disclosure of conventional banks is significantly higher than the Islamic banks. In addition, the degree of mandatory corporate governance disclosure is significantly and positively related to the growth of deposits for both Islamic and conventional UAE listed banks
