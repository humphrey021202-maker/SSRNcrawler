Abstract

We examine whether retail information awareness and acquisition costs (RIAAC) affect market liquidity using mandatory interactions between Chinese listed firms and retail investors that reduce these costs. We find significant reductions in market liquidity measured by trading volume, stock turnover, price impact, and bid-ask spread. Furthermore, we observe significant decreases in return volatility but no changes in investor disagreement, suggesting that the reduction in noise trading drives the observed decrease in liquidity. Using accountlevel data, we document that retail trading decreases after the interactions. The reduction in liquidity is not due to changes in firm disclosures. Finally, we find that stock prices exhibit additional reactions to previously announced earnings surprises following the interactions, suggesting that reducing RIAAC accelerates the incorporation of neglected information into prices.

Keywords: Information costs, Information awareness, Information acquisition, Retail investors, Noise trading, Liquidity, Earnings announcements

JEL Classification: G14, G18, G41
