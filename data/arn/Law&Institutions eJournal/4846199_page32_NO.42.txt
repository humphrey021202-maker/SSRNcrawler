Abstract

Blockholder activism is characterized by large shareholders with a declared intention to exert influence in corporate decision-making. Researchers have frequently used blockholder activist events as a means to investigate a variety of topics in Corporate Finance. While regulatory filings, the primary source of data, are publicly available, the process of extracting a suitable events dataset, one that exclusively includes instances in which an external investor targets a company with the intent to exert influence on its business, lacks thorough documentation, making it unfeasible to be reliably reproduced. In this paper, we discuss key considerations for using public data to compile an activist dataset that identifies non-core activist blockholder events. Furthermore, we investigate the consequences of failing to exclude these non-core events on two common research outcomes: short-term abnormal returns and ownership stakes. This work represents an initial step toward establishing a fully reproducible process for dataset assembly, potentially reducing barriers to future research in this field.

Keywords: activist investors, blockholder activism, corporate governance, data collection, data extraction, reproducibility
