Abstract

Managing working capital, such as trade credit, is essential for operational sustainability and firm growth in emerging markets. Unfortunately, empirical evidence is lacking on whether corporate governance influences trade credit in India. Our study helps to fill this gap. It also provides new insights on the determinants of trade credit receivables and payables in an emerging market. We find a significantly positive association between CEO duality and trade credit receivables. Although centralizing power by Indian firms heightens exposure to operational risk, it may enhance sales and increase profitability. Additionally, managers of firms with centralized control tend to be conservative, reducing their dependence on creditors and alternative financing of their current assets.

Keywords: Corporate governance, Trade credit, receivables, payables, panel data
