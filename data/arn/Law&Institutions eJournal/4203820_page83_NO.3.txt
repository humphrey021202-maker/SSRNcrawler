Abstract

The widespread adoption of performance-contingent compensation plans has widened the gap between executives' ex-ante reported pay and realized take-home pay, raising questions about whether these plans truly reward performance. Using hand-collected data on realized payouts from CEOs' long-term accounting-based incentive plans (LTAPs), we show that both payout likelihood and magnitude are positively associated with firm performance, and these relations are not moderated by earnings management, contract design, or corporate governance. Shareholders react positively when firms disclose payouts at or above target. Following such payouts, the likelihood of failing Say-on-Pay and CEO turnover both decline. Payout levels also predict whether firms continue LTAPs or revise performance metrics and horizons. Although LTAP payouts generally reflect performance, a subset of weakly governed firms make excessive, non-performance-based payouts, suggesting managerial rent-seeking. None of these insights can be inferred from plan target values. Collectively, our findings highlight the informational value of realized payouts.
