Abstract

We investigate overboarded (or busy) directors, documenting differences by gender in their effects on environmental and social scores, with female directors having negative impacts. The findings suggest that this negative effect is associated with tokenism practices of firms, as well as specialization in business-related expertise and financial oversight, rather than a broader range of qualifications of busy female directors. We use California’s quota introduction as a shock to establish the causal relation of gender quota with directors’ busyness, providing evidence that it is a plausible reason for the increase in overboarded female directors in recent years.

Keywords: busy directors, boards, ES, synthetic controls, gender quotas, policy evaluation

JEL Classification: G30, G38, G41
