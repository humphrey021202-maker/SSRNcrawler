Abstract

We examine whether implementing a stricter bankruptcy framework influences the cost management behavior of borrowing firms. Specifically, we explore whether the increased liquidation threat resulting from improved creditor rights and reduced renegotiation flexibility induces borrowers to manage Selling, General & Administrative (SG&A) costs more conservatively. Using a sample of Indian firms around the enactment of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) in 2016, we find that post-IBC borrowers respond to sales declines by promptly reducing SG&A expenditures, and they refrain from excessive SG&A growth when sales increase. Further analyses indicate that this effect is more pronounced in firms with higher bankruptcy risk, severe agency conflicts, relationships with creditors having stronger liquidation bias, and jurisdictions with greater judicial efficiency. Further analyses indicate that these SG&A cost management strategies effectively mitigate downside risk, enhance performance, and reduce future bankruptcy risk.
