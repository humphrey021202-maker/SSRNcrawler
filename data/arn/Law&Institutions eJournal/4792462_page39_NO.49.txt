Abstract

We develop a simple quantitative model of a bank to study hidden loan losses under regulatory scrutiny. The model incorporates stochastic regulatory audit, enabling temporary concealment of losses. Calibration shows that banks typically hide about 0.8% of loan portfolios as defaulted loans. Following a contractionary aggregate shock, this rises sharply to 2.9% staying elevated for four years. We further show that hidden defaults heighten the risk of bank failure and increase its expected costs.

Keywords: Hidden Loan Losses, Asset Quality Review

JEL Classification: G21, G28, M41, M48
