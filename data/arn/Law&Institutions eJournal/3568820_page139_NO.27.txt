Abstract

SFAS 141 (ASC 805) requires that firms record identifiable assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations at fair value. While the FASB argued that these fair values should provide users with incremental decision-useful information, opponents have continuously argued that they are too difficult to reliably estimate and could be subject to managerial discretion. Using hand-collected data from U.S. mergers and acquisitions, we find that, on average, fair value adjustments predict future cash flows incrementally beyond pre-deal book values and cash flows, goodwill, and other firm and deal characteristics. We also find that the relation between fair value adjustments and future cash flows varies predictably based on several factors that affect managers’ ability and incentives to provide accurate estimates. Furthermore, despite prevailing concerns about their usefulness, we find that fair values for intangible assets predict future cash flows, on average. However, we find that this relation is driven primarily by the fair values of customer- and contract-related intangible assets, and that the fair values of other types of identifiable intangibles do not necessarily convey incremental decision-useful information. Finally, we find that users appear to rely on the information conveyed by these disclosures, as evidenced by revisions to analysts’ forecasts and changes in stock prices. Overall, our findings provide insight regarding the usefulness of current standards and users’ reliance on fair values in business combinations.
