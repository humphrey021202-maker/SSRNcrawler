Abstract

We document that employee bankruptcy costs affect corporate capital structure decisions via their impact on bargaining power of labor unions. We employ difference-in-differences and difference-in-difference-in-differences research designs surrounding a major bankruptcy reform that increased personal bankruptcy costs. Our results suggest that on average this reform reduced unions’ bargaining power, resulting in a decrease in the financial leverage of unionized firms relative to nonunionized firms. Our results provide new evidence for a relatively unexplored determinant of capital structure — personal bankruptcy costs.

Keywords: Capital structure, Personal bankruptcy costs, BAPCPA, Union bargaining power
