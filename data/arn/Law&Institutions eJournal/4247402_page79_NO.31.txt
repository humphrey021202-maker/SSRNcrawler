Abstract

Do corporate social responsibility (CSR) metrics accurately reflect firms’ material social impacts? We examine small business lending during the Great Recession and uncover a paradox: banks deemed to be socially responsible actually imposed higher social costs by actively pulling funds from those in need of liquidity. These banks allocated more resources to immaterial but conspicuous areas during the boom, earning favorable assessments. However, when the downturn arrived, they had less slack, resulting in tightened lending and increased procyclicality. Our results suggest that without reliable metrics for firms’ social impacts, increased attention to stakeholderism could ironically lead to a decrease in social welfare.

Keywords: corporate social responsibility, stakeholder theory, bank lending, social impact assessment, credit crunch, Great Recession

JEL Classification: G00, G21, G34
