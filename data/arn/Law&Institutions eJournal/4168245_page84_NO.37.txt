Abstract

Federal support for corporate firms during the Covid-19 crisis was not universal. This paper shows that both firms receiving direct federal support and those receiving signals of future support make materially different financial decisions during a crisis. Using a triple differences approach around the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility (SMCCF), we find a persistent 4-7% difference in firm leverage explained by variation in explicit policy eligibility and the Fed’s revealed preferences for certain types of firms. These leverage effects outlast the bond market effects found by prior studies and scale positively with more granular measures of firm eligibility.
