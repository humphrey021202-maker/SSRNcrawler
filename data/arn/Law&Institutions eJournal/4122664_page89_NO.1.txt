Abstract

This monograph provides an overview of the theories of disclosure regulation and recent developments in the disclosure regulation literature. We organize our discussion around three basic questions. First, why do we need to regulate corporate disclosure in the financial market? Second, which theories explain the current state of disclosure regulation? Third, what are the economic consequences of disclosure regulation? In exploring the third question, we discuss several examples of disclosure regulation related to information production, dissemination, and presentation. Then, we provide an overview of the current debate on mandating environmental, social and governance (ESG) disclosure and reporting. Finally, we conclude by discussing emerging issues of disclosure regulation and potential avenues for future research.

Keywords: Regulation, corporate disclosure, financial reporting, capital market, political economy, information asymmetry

JEL Classification: D78, D82, G14, G18, G38, K22, K42, M14, M48, Q56
