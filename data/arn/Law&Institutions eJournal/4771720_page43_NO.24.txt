Abstract

We claim that prosocial activities undertaken by companies in the form of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) demand a different explanation from the traditional economic approaches. We present a model where each stakeholder (either customer, supplier, employee, or investor) is engaged in a contractual relationship with a firm. However, there are always unforeseen contingencies that are not covered by the terms of the contract. In case some unexpected adverse event occurs, altruistic companies are more likely to resolve the conflict in favor of their stakeholders. Consequently, stakeholders are willing to pay a premium to engage with an altruistic firm rather than with a selfish one, and altruistic firms have an incentive to demonstrate their altruism convincingly. But, how can stakeholders detect which companies are truly altruistic? We consider that CSR activities are used by the companies as a reliable signal of their genuine concern with stakeholders’ welfare. We characterize a unique separating equilibrium in which only truly altruistic companies signal their types by engaging in CSR activities. In this context, the total amount of CSR supplied in the market is shown to depend positively on the level of uncertainty surrounding unforeseen circumstances that are not covered by formal contracts.

Keywords: Corporate Social Responsibility, Incomplete contracts, Signaling, altruism
