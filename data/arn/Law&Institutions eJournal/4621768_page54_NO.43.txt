Abstract

This study examines carbon accounting's impact on Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM), environmental costs, sustainable value added (SVA), and sustainable financial performance in the Indonesian chemical industry. It employs a quantitative approach, collecting data through a comprehensive industry survey. Structural equation modeling shows that carbon accounting strongly influences GSCM adoption, with GSCM and SVA mediating the link between carbon accounting and sustainable financial performance. Organizations implementing carbon accounting practices enhance environmental responsibility, leading to improved financial performance. The study emphasizes the significance of eco-friendly supply chain integration for better financial results.

Keywords: Carbon accounting, GSCM, environmental costs, sustainable value-added, sustainable financial performance
