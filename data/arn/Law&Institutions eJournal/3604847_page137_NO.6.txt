Abstract

Using an hourly dataset on retail investor individual security positions from Robinhood Markets, we find no evidence that ESG disclosures inform retail investors’ buy and sell decisions. The response on ESG press release days by retail investors is indistinguishable from non-event days. In contrast, these same investors make economically meaningful changes to their portfolios in response to non-ESG press releases, especially those that pertain to earnings announcements. We use stock return tests to show that there is economic content in ESG press releases, and we conduct subsample analyses showing that retail investors do not respond to the most salient and economically transparent ESG disclosures. Collectively, these tests suggest that a lack of economic content, a lack of visibility, and difficulty with investment integration are unlikely to explain our findings.

Keywords: ESG, Retail Investors, Corporate Social Responsibility
