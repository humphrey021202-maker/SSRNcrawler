Abstract

The book "Corporate Ownership and Control: International Trends" examines the corporate governance systems in nine countries (the USA, Italy, Spain, Turkey, New Zealand, China, Brazil, India, Nigeria) with particular emphasis on corporate ownership and control issues. This book picks up several very important issues related to corporate governance. Is corporate ownership and control still nationally driven issue or not? What sort of corporate governance regulation is more effective – soft or strict? Does family ownership produce a new model for corporate ownership and control? Is corporate law able to account all those national peculiarities of corporate ownership and control on one side, and respect the worldwide best practices in corporate governance on another side?
