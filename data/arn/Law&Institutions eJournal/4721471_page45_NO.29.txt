Abstract

This study examines firms’ classification shifting reporting practices when their CEO compensation contracts have incentive awards based on “core” earnings. CEO compensation contracts increasingly include performance metrics based on core profitability. We predict and find that firms are more likely to misclassify recurring operating expenses as transitory special items when the CEO’s performance-contingent compensation is based on “core” earnings. This reporting maneuver is more pronounced when there is a greater dollar amount of cash bonus awards or a greater percentage of unearned equity awards contingent on core earnings performance, when bright-line core earnings thresholds are identified for these awards, or when CEOs command greater power. We further find that CEOs earn more cash bonuses and equity compensation through classification shifting when compensation contracts contain core earnings performance metrics. Our findings provide initial evidence on how compensation contracts incentivize top management to engage in expense misclassification for personal gains.

Keywords: Compensation contract, classification shifting, core earnings, EBITDA, performance-contingent award, bonus, equity compensation.
