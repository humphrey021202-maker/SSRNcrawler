Abstract

We examine whether coverage by analysts affiliated with lenders affects loan contracting. We find that loans to borrowers covered by affiliated analysts have lower spreads but more financial covenants. Further analyses suggest that the results are driven mostly by affiliated analysts sharing information with, but not demanding information from, the lending side. Exploiting plausibly exogenous variation in affiliated analysts generated by changes in brokerage house affiliation, we find that the result is likely to be causal. The results suggest that analysts could transfer private information to their affiliated lenders and improve lender monitoring.

Keywords: Affiliated Analysts, Monitoring, Loan Contracting

JEL Classification: G23, G32, G24
