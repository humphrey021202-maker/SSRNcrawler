Abstract

Using data from 44 international equity markets, we document a robust dividend premium averaging 0.58% per month after adjusting for global and regional risk factors. We uncover a novel mechanism: dividend premia are driven by coordinated demand shocks tied to the predictable clustering of ex-dividend events. Within markets, dividend-paying stocks earn excess returns concentrated in ex-dividend months, reflecting spikes in investor demand. Across markets, synchronization of dividend calendars produces substantial international comovement in dividend premia. These results reveal that dividend returns are not simply local anomalies or tax-driven effects, but manifestations of a globally salient style factor that influences investor behavior, return predictability, and cross-market integration.

Keywords: Dividend premium, Return comovement, International studies, Asset pricing

JEL Classification: G12, G35, N20
