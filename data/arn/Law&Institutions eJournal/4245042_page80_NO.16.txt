Abstract

This paper examines whether a higher proportion of co-opted board members following a CEO’s accession translates to greater climate change-related risk for the firm. Investigating 12,101 US-based firm-year observations from 2002-2014, we discover that firms with a higher level of co-opted directors face higher climate risk. This conclusion survives a battery of tests addressing reverse causality, omitted variable bias, and sample selection bias. We touch on this result’s implications and offer ideas for advancing the discourse further.

Keywords: Board Co-option, Climate Change Risk, Agency Problems, Corporate Governance
