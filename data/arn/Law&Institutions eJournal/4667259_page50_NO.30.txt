Abstract

We examine the impact of shocks to analyst busyness on competing analysts, investors, managers, and firms using a novel experiment that increases analyst busyness but leaves analyst coverage of firms unchanged. The research quality of both shocked (“treated”) and competing (“untreated”) analysts at shocked (“treated”) firms declines post-shock. The treated firms’ institutional ownership as well as the quantity and quality of managerial voluntary disclosures also decline. These findings suggest that increased analyst busyness has significant negative spillovers to competing analysts, investors, and managers. Consequently, there is deterioration in treated firms’ information environments, stock price performance, and valuation.

Keywords: Sell-side analysts; Analyst busyness; Spillover Effects, Information environment; Firm monitoring

JEL Classification: G30, G32, G34, K22, L22, L25
