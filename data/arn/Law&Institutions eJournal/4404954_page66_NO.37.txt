Abstract

Adding to the stream of corporate governance literature, this study presents a simple method to examine the role of corporate board. It deconstructs the board type based on the interaction between the CEO and the board and among the board members. A simple two time period model is formulated to derive various hypotheses that can be tested using empirical analysis.

Keywords: Corporate Governance, Board Structure, CEO, Executive decision-making

JEL Classification: G3, D7
