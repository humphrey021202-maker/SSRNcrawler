Abstract

We examine the role of bank debt in corporate tax strategies using a sample of 31,846 firms from 53 countries. Our findings provide robust evidence that bank debt is positively related to tax avoidance, consistent with the view that banks compel firms to utilize tax savings for debt service. Importantly, this effect is stronger for firms with a higher probability of default and those in countries with less effective debt enforcement mechanisms. Our results are robust across various samples, alternative explanations, and considerations for endogeneity

Keywords: corporate tax strategies, default, debt enforcement, Bank debt

JEL Classification: G32, G34, H26, H25, G35
