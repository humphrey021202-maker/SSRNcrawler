Abstract

We examine the information content of voluntary artificial intelligence (AI) disclosures in corporate annual reports. Utilizing a novel approach that integrates traditional keyword-based textual analysis with large language models, we classify AI-related disclosures into categories such as revenue generation, cost reduction, and various AI-related risks. Our analysis reveals that AI disclosure has significantly increased across all industry sectors since 2010 and strongly correlates with a firm’s actual AI activities, as indicated by AI-related job postings. We also find that AI revenue and cost disclosures provide additional predictive information beyond a firm's current AI activities, offering insights into future growth, investment, and operational efficiency. Furthermore, AI risk disclosures are associated with higher tail risk for firms. Our findings suggest that voluntary AI disclosures reflect a firm’s current engagement in AI and offer valuable forward-looking information about the risks and opportunities linked to AI, useful for external stakeholders in assessing a firm’s AI involvement.

Keywords: Artificial intelligence, 10-K disclosure, firm growth, risk
