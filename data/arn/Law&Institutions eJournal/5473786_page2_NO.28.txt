Abstract

Utilizing Tax Information Exchange Agreements (TIEAs) as a shock to tax information sharing regimes between the U.S. and tax havens, we examine their impact on corporate patenting strategies. Affected firms reduce incremental innovation while increasing radical innovation after TIEAs, without changing R&D expenditures. The reduction (increase) in incremental (radical) innovation is more pronounced for firms with stronger income-shifting incentives (greater information opacity). This shift in innovation strategies is stronger when the exchange of tax information is implemented effectively, when firms are held by long-term investors and possess technological/financial feasibility. TIEAs cause the value of incremental (radical) innovation to decrease (increase). We conclude that, reducing offshore tax avoidance and improving information transparency, TIEAs lead to an improvement in corporate innovation quality resulting from better resource allocations.

Keywords: tax information sharing, TIEAs, patenting strategy, incremental innovation, radical innovation
