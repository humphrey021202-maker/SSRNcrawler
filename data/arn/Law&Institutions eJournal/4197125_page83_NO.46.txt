Abstract

We focus on management earnings forecasts following debt covenant violations and examine managers’ strategic communication with bank lenders during private loan renegotiations. While the incomplete contracting theory emphasizes the importance of renegotiation following a decline in borrowers’ economic performance, how managers provide forward-looking information to lenders during the renegotiation is still unclear. We posit that managers violating debt covenants have incentives to offer optimistically biased forward-looking information to ease potential penalties imposed by bank lenders. Analyzing a sample of Japanese listed firms, whose managers are required to publish annual earnings forecasts immediately after or during debt renegotiations, we find that firms are more likely to issue optimistic earnings forecasts after debt covenant violations. Furthermore, these optimistic forecasts are likely to reduce increases in loan spreads and the likelihood of forced CEO turnover owing to debt covenant violations. Overall, we provide fresh insights into strategic managerial communication during debt contract renegotiations, as well as practical implications for capital suppliers.

Keywords: Debt covenants, Management earnings forecast, Management optimism, Covenant violation, Renegotiation, Debt contract, Incomplete contracting theory
