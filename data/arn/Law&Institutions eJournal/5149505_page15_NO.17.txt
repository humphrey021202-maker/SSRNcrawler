Abstract

We examine whether regulatory mandates intended to improve managerial risk assessments can paradoxically increase corporate misconduct. We exploit the staggered adoption of Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) mandates in the U.S. insurance industry, which require managers to systematically identify, assess, and integrate firm-wide risks into operational decisions. Following the implementation of this regulation, insurers subsequently increase the aggressiveness of their underwriting and claims practices, resulting in a roughly 24 percent increase in the likelihood of an insurance violation. Cross-sectional analyses explain this paradox through two interrelated channels. Managers learn that the complex indirect risks of misconduct (e.g., reputation, political costs) are lower than previously assumed, removing a deterrent effect of uncertainty. Managers then substitute into these more aggressive underwriting and claims practices when other financial risk-taking opportunities are curtailed. Our findings highlight a paradox of regulation: by improving information, ERM mandates may displace risk-taking activities, creating unintended spillovers with real costs for stakeholders.

Keywords: operational misconduct, internal information quality, risk assessment, enterprise risk management
