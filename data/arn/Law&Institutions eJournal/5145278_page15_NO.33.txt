Abstract

We use a structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) model to improve existing cross-sectional corporate payout smoothing studies. First, we endogenize the net income shocks within a multi-equation framework in panel data, capturing the dynamic feedback between net income and various smoothing channels, namely debt and investments. Second, in line with dynamic models, in the presence of different structural shocks, we exploit impulse response functions to capture the role of smoothing channels over time. Our model is applied to a sample of organizations operating in U.S. financial markets. We compare our results with cross-sectional corporate payout smoothing predictions and provide robust evidence of the dynamic interplay between debt and investments as smoothing channels within the net income–payout association.

Keywords: Payout smoothing, Debt, Investment, Structural vector autoregressive model, Panel data
