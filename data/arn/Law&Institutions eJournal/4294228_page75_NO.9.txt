Abstract

We show that private equity (PE) buyouts enable firms to borrow against cash flows, thereby raising borrowing capacity. Unlike comparable non PE-backed firms that primarily use asset-based debt, PE-backed firms rely extensively on cash flow-based debt subject to earnings-based borrowing constraints, and their borrowing and investment exhibit high sensitivity to earnings. Enhancing access to and utilization of cash flow-based borrowing, private equity raises both the level and cash flow sensitivity of leverage. Documenting that PE sponsors inject equity and stabilize earnings in distress, we highlight PE sponsors' involvement in distress resolution as a key mechanism that facilitates cash flow-based borrowing.
