Abstract

This article considers a hypothetical corporate decision that will generate $5 million of profit today but result in the loss of one human life in ten years. This example is not abstract; corporations in a range of businesses engage in decisions and oversight that affect risk to human life: autonomous cars and airbags, pharmaceuticals and medical devices, and many categories of consumer products. Historically, social policy has responded to corporations that kill primarily through regulation and tort liability. I ask whether corporate law and governance might also address these issues. If corporations really are “people,” how should we think about them when they kill? The article assesses the literatures on the value of human life and relevant discount rates, and considers proposals to incentivize directors and officers to consider more explicitly the risks their corporations pose to human life.

Keywords: Corporate Law, Liability, Tort Liability, Regulation, Regulation and Tort Liability Costs in Terms of Human Life

App. 1992) (describing lower court finding that directors breached their fiduciary duties by "retaining a manager inexperienced in hedging; failing to maintain reasonable supervision over him; and failing to attain knowledge of the basic fundamentals of hedging to be able to direct the hedging activities and supervise the manager properly"). Arguably, the Delaware courts have moved in the opposite direction, showing deference in cases addressing financial risk, even with respect to bankers' oversight failures during the financial crisis
