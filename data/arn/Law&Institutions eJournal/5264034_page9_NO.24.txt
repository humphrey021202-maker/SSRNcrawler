Abstract

This paper investigates the impact of local newspaper closures on corporate tax avoidance. Using a difference-indifference analysis of 2,155 firm-years, we find that firms faced with local newspaper closures increase their tax avoidance levels, resulting in a 5% decrease in effective tax rates. Upon closer examination, we show that financially constrained and locally embedded firms exhibit stronger responses. Higher overall media presence and stronger informal institutions mitigate this effect. Our findings underscore the critical role of local newspapers in monitoring corporate behavior and safeguarding public revenue.

Keywords: Newspaper, Tax Avoidance, Media, Corporate Finance, Corporate Governance
