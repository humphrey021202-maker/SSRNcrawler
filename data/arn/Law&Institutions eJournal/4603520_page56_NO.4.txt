Abstract

This paper examines the impact of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) misconduct on firm's financial access. Examining European firms from 2015 to 2020, we find that engaging in irresponsible ESG actions leads to worse access to finance conditions, characterized by higher financial constraints. Conversely, while firms with a stronger reputation enjoy better finance conditions, they will still face increased financial constraints if they undertake irresponsible ESG actions. Moreover, the negative effect of ESG misconduct on financial access is not influenced by CEO power, highlighting that although CEOs may be effective in preventing ESG failures, they are not successful in mitigating the adverse financial consequences.

Keywords: ESG misconduct, ESG, reputation, financial constraints
