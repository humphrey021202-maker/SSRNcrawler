Abstract

This study reveals that the connectedness between US firms can be both “good” (ownership) and “bad” (boardroom). Network links through ownership increase return on assets by 0.12%, while board networks decrease it by 0.07%. BIG3 institutional investors’ connections yield higher return on assets, particularly among same-industry firms, indicating beneficial product-market peer effects. Conversely, boardroom connectedness negatively affects performance, with male directors driving this effect. We exploit the annual Russell 1000/2000 index reconstitution as an exogenous shock to institutional ownership networks to establish causality.

Keywords: ownership, boards, network analysis, indexing, corporate governance, institutional investors, financial performance, product market peers
