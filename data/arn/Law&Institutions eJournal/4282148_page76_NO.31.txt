Abstract

Institutional investors in Japan increasingly care about corporate governance of investee companies since the Japanese government launched dual governance-related codes: Stewardship Code in 2014 and Corporate Governance Code in 2015. We find that institutional investors increase their portfolio weights on high payout companies after the launch of the codes. Portfolios investing in companies that conduct large payouts during the pre-Code period make significant excess returns during the post-code period. These high payout firms also increase market-to-book ratio after the Code. The results suggest that investors add premium to high payout companies when they increasingly pay attention to corporate governance.

Keywords: Dividend premium, Repurchase premium, Corporate governance, Institutional investor, Catering
