The Financial Factors Driving ESG

33 Pages Posted: 6 Dec 2023

Richard Paul Gregory

East Tennessee State University

Date Written: November 6, 2023

Abstract

I examine the financial factors affecting a firm's Environmental, Social, and Governance scores in developed and emerging markets. I find that Capitalized R&D raises Governance activities. ESG activities hedge market risk. Political risk leads to less firm-specific shareholder protections and there is no clear relationship between firm size and ESG scores. I find mandatory reporting requirements improve Social scores.

Keywords: Sustainability, ESG, Corporate Social Responsibility

JEL Classification: G39, G37
