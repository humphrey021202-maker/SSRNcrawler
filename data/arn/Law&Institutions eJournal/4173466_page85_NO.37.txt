Abstract

We examine the ownership structure of U.S. corporations using a comprehensive database of share ownership by insiders, affiliated firms, and institutional investors. Ownership concentration has risen in recent years, particularly in larger firms, reducing the costs of shareholder communication and activism. From 2015 to 2021, a firm’s top 10 institutional shareholders owned 40% of the firm, and insiders and affiliates owned 9%. Ownership structures are often dominated by large diversified institutions, but a substantial subset of firms have blockholders with significant exposure to the firm and long investment horizons, who are less likely to exit an underperforming firm than other institutions. Many of these blockholders are not ‘activists,’ so their engagement is likely behind the scenes. The findings suggest that ownership structures have adapted to the rise in passive investing in ways that mitigate institutional barriers to shareholder monitoring.

Keywords: Ownership Structure, Corporate Governance, Institutional Investors

JEL Classification: G32, G23
