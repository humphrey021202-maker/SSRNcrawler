Abstract

This study delves into the intricate relationship between board expertise diversity and firm performance in a sample of Spanish listed firms, employing a comprehensive analysis grounded in the agency and resource dependence theories. Machine-learning techniques are used to sort board directors by area of expertise to gain a more nuanced perspective on the topic in hand. Employing two diversity measures revealing limitations of conventional metrics for capturing true board diversity. Using a panel dataset spanning the period 2007-2020, our results underscore the positive impact of expertise diversity on firm performance. Industry-specific analyses elucidate diverse impacts, with technology and consumer industries showing most benefit. Notably, financial expertise stands out as a pivotal asset, with banking-related financial expertise proving more beneficial for value, and political, management, and fiscal expertise also demonstrating positive impacts on firm performance. Contrasting effects are observed for legal and academic expertise, which exhibit a negative association with performance.

Keywords: Board expertise, expertise diversity, independent directors, machine learning, firm performance
