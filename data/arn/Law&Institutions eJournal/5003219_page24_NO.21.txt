Abstract

This article discusses two decisions of the Belgian Supreme Court on the compatibility of the Belgian net asset tax with the Belgium-Luxembourg Income and Capital Tax Treaty (1970) and the Belgium-Netherlands Income and Capital Tax Treaty (2001), which raise questions regarding "tax on capital", "taxes covered" and treaty interpretation.
