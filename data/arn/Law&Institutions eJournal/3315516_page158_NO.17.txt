Abstract

We study the role of a company founder in its internal governance. Using a sample of 484 CEO turnovers for 2000-2015, we establish that CEOs are red for poor performance. However, the likelihood of a poor-performing founder-CEO being fired is lower than that of an outsider CEO. Moreover, having a founder as a member of the executive or supervisory board decreases the likelihood that a CEO will be dismissed for poor performance. Similarly, founder ownership may have the same effect on CEO turnover. Finally, being a founder does not guarantee a poor-performing CEO a chairman position after being fired.

Keywords: Founder Involvement; CEO Turnover; Corporate Governance; Firm Performance

JEL Classification: G30, M13, M50
