Abstract

Standard setters and prior research have focused on how investors expect firms’ sustainability activities to affect financial performance. We examine whether investment professionals also care about the benefits to society of firms’ sustainability activities beyond any such financial effects and how this influences their investment decisions. Using experiments, we find that, consistent with our theory, the availability of sustainability information results in both German and US investment professionals increasing their investments beyond any expected financial effect. Further, after controlling for any financial effects, both groups make higher investments as their assessments of a firm’s sustainability performance increase. We validate that these effects are driven by investment professionals’ concerns for society by confirming that the latter effect is stronger for those who generally believe that firms’ sustainability activities provide important benefits to society. Although our main results hold for both German and US investment professionals, we also provide initial evidence of some differences in how US and German investment professionals use sustainability disclosures that are consistent with a stronger shareholder focus among US investors versus a broader stakeholder focus among European investors. Finally, we offer initial evidence suggesting that firms’ sustainability activities affect investment professionals’ recommendations to clients in the same way they affect their personal investment decisions. Our findings are important for standard setters and regulators when assessing the costs and benefits of mandating sustainability reporting. Implications for investors and researchers are also discussed.

Keywords: sustainability disclosures, corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosures, motivated reasoning, investment professionals, societal benefits
