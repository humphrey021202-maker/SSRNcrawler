Abstract

This study empirically examines the role of corporate culture in shaping firms’ financial reporting practices, specifically on earnings management perspective. Drawing on a comprehensive dataset of earnings call transcripts and 10-K report from U.S.-listed companies spanning 2001 to 2021, we find that firms with strong cultural values—such as innovation, integrity, quality, respect, and teamwork- significantly less likely to engage in discretionary accruals-based earnings management. Our results remain robust after applying instrumental variables, placebo tests, and alternative variable specifications. Further analysis reveals that a stricter regulatory environment weakens the influence of corporate culture on earnings management, whereas competitive pressure amplifies this relationship.

Keywords: corporate culture, Earnings management, machine learning, earnings call transcript
