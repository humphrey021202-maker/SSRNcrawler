Abstract

ESG has rapidly become a household name leading to both confusion about what it means and creating unrealistic expectations about its effects. In this paper, I draw on more than a decade of research to dispel several myths about ESG and provide answers to important questions around theories of influence, the relation between ESG and corporate value, and the usefulness of ESG assessments and ratings.
