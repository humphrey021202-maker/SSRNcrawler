Abstract

Defining company performance is a key issue in the debate between shareholderism versus stakeholderism. Formerly opposing views have converged since Jensen (2002) initiated the shift from shareholder primacy to considering other financiers as well, and Freeman et al. (2004) defined total value creation as an objective function for a firm. By introducing concepts of IN- and OUT-stakeholders, we generalize measures of company value and profit from a single stakeholder focus (shareholders only) to multiple stakeholder settings in an economically sound way. Our measures are based on stakeholders’ risk preferences and the concept of residual income advocated by Ohlson (1995), among others. Those measures can be used to specify performance and the payment of compensation in stakeholder-oriented companies. The role of a country’s tax authority in the context of measuring stakeholder value can also be redefined.

Keywords: shareholder primacy, shareholderism, stakeholderism, performance measurement, valuation

JEL Classification: G30, M20, M40
