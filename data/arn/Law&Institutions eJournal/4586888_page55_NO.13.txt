Abstract

The ongoing contemporary financial crisis has emerged as a formidable challenge for the Sri Lankan banking industry, intricately entwined with both global economic uncertainties and local economic dynamics. This research paper adopts a qualitative research methodology to delve into the nuanced repercussions of the crisis on Sri Lankan banks. Through a series of in-depth interviews with key stakeholders in the banking sector, including senior executives, regulatory authorities, and economists, this study seeks to illuminate the multifaceted dimensions of the crisis's impact. Utilizing thematic analysis as the analytical framework, the paper uncovers the complex tapestry of challenges encountered by banks, the strategies they have employed to navigate this uncharted terrain, and the invaluable lessons gleaned from their experiences. In doing so, this qualitative exploration not only adds depth to our understanding of the contemporary financial crisis's effects on the Sri Lankan banking industry but also offers a nuanced perspective on the resilience, adaptability, and forward-thinking approaches undertaken by banks during these turbulent times. The insights unearthed through this research are invaluable for not only comprehending the immediate implications but also for envisioning a more resilient and responsive future for the banking sector in Sri Lanka.
