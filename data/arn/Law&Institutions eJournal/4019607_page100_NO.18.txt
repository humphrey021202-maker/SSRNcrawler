Abstract

We study how vertical integration shapes firms' public disclosures. Theory suggests that firms can use public disclosure to coordinate with supply chain partners and predicts a substitution between vertical integration and public disclosure of future strategic plans, since the internalization of production reduces the need to publicly coordinate. Using data on the extent of vertical integration, we find that firms that become more vertically integrated reduce their public disclosures about their product strategies and that the reduction is most pronounced for vertically integrated firms with greater internalization of production and those with the largest informational and strategic frictions along the supply chain.

Keywords: Firm Boundaries, Vertical Integration, Product Disclosure, Coordination Role of Disclosure

JEL Classification: D83, G14, L14, M41
