Abstract

This study presents a comprehensive case analysis on the implementation and reversal of impairment tests for Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E) assets under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), specifically focusing on the first-time adoption in Uzbekistan. Utilizing an Excel-based algorithm, we address the intricacies of aligning national accounting practices with IFRS requirements, emphasizing the nexus between IAS 36 and IFRS 1 standards. The paper details the novel approach of safeguarding against the over-reversal of impairments, ensuring compliance with IAS 36's paragraph 117. The study highlights Uzbekistan unique transition context, wherein large state-controlled entities underwent IFRS transition amid the COVID-19 pandemic, necessitating initial impairments followed by partial reversals as economic conditions stabilized. The algorithm is tailored to integrate with a widely used "1C" accounting software in Uzbekistan and Central Asia, facilitating automated allocation and reversal processes. Our findings indicate that this method effectively adjusts the net carrying amounts to reflect accurate values in use (VIU), providing a robust framework for entities in similar transitional economies. This work offers valuable insights into the operational challenges and solutions for IFRS adoption, contributing to the broader discourse on global financial reporting harmonization.

Keywords: IFRS adoption, impairment tests, value in use, cash-generating unit, impairment reversal, Uzbekistan, IAS 36
