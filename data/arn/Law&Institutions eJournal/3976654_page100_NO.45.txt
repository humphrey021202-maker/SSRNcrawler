Abstract

Employees, who take pride and ownership of firms they work for, are likely to be more productive and safeguard the interests of the employers. Malawian banks promoted employee share schemes from 2000 but there evidence that the euphoria on this matter is waning as fewer banks are administering the schemes and this could possibly be attributed to huge financial illiteracy amongst banks’ employees. Gaps in the financial reporting in respect of the employee share schemes are evident and there is need to amend the Companies Act to clearly spell out types and conditions of employee share schemes to reduce unintended legal exposures.

Keywords: Employee; Ownership; Bank; Share; Malawi
