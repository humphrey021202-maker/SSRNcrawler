Abstract

Exploiting tax withholding elections around equity compensation transactions, we find that transactions involving tax withholdings predict annualized next month returns that are 4% – 8% lower than other transactions. The informativeness of tax withholding elections is stronger in the presence of greater information asymmetry and following personal tax rate changes. Tax withholding elections are more likely to occur in blackout trading periods than sales and are more predictive of earnings announcement surprises. Insiders eventually sued by the SEC change their tax withholding elections more frequently, and the informativeness of withholding is lower in the year of an SEC enforcement action.

Keywords: Form 4, Insider trading, Option exercises, Private information, Signaling, Stock-based compensation, Tax withholding
