Abstract

Using a novel dataset where institutional investors explain their votes—voting rationales—we provide direct evidence on the motivations behind votes in director elections. Lack of independence and board diversity are top reasons for opposing directors. These rationales accurately reflect firms’ real weaknesses rather than investors’ rationale-washing. Subsequently, firms respond by adjusting board composition. Our results are not driven by proxy advisors’ rationales or direct engagement. Instead, voting rationales emerge as a unique communication tool, enabling firms to address investors’ specific concerns. Results suggest that institutional investors’ attention to voting decisions is more widespread than previously documented.

Keywords: institutional investors, voting, voting rationales, corporate governance

JEL Classification: G11, G23, G30
