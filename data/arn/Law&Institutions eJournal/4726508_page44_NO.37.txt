Abstract

The private equity industry is characterized by limited regulatory oversight and private communication with investors, yet some private equity firms issue publicly disseminated press releases. We explore a potential motivation for this disclosure: reducing investors' information cost of identifying new investments. We find that private equity firms issue significantly more press releases in fundraising event windows relative to non-fundraising event windows. Press releases appear effective as they are associated with higher fund growth after controlling for past performance, firm size, and deals. This association is strongest for firms less able to rely on prior reputation of superior performance. In an additional analysis, we find evidence consistent with increased press release activity following SEC amendments that expanded the pool of investors eligible to invest in private markets. 

Keywords: Private equity, press releases, SEC regulations, sophisticated investors
