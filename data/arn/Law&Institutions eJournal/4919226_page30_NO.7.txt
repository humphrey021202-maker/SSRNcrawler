Abstract

A Strictly Ledger-based Security (SLBS) is characterized as the only representation of an investment right in a decentralized ledger. Theoretical research suggests that this new form of capital can potentially enhance governance effectiveness and transparency compared to alternative financing. We contribute by providing the first examination of these theoretical expectations and conjectures by reviewing the governance-related features of a set of Strictly Ledger-Based Equity Securities in Switzerland based. In an additional analysis, we discuss and compare further characteristics of Strictly Ledger-Based Securities with previous forms of capital.

Keywords: Entrepreneurial finance, Corporate governance, FinTech, Blockchain, Distributed ledger technologies, Securities Token Offerings
