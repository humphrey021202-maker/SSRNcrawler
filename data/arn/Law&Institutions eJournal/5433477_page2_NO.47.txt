Abstract

We study how government transparency laws affect firm outcomes by examining major expansions in state-level Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) laws. Using a stacked difference-in-differences design, we find that affected firms increase disclosure frequency and quality, face greater product market competition, and experience declines in operating profitability, abnormal stock returns, and firm value, along with higher downside risk. The value effects are stronger for firms with greater government exposure and higher information asymmetry. These findings suggest that increased transparency, which can be socially beneficial, imposes significant economic costs on firms by exposing their proprietary information.

Keywords: Firm Disclosures, Firm Performance, Freedom of Information Act Laws, FOIA, Government Transparency, Open Government, Open Records, State Regulation
