Local Government Financing Vehicles Shareholding and Corporate Earnings Management: A Discussion on the Dual Mechanisms of Resource Provision and Governance Optimization

Abstract

Our analysis of a comprehensive panel dataset covering all Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listed firms (2009-2021) reveals that LGFVs exert significant disciplinary effects, curbing both corporate accrual-based and real earnings management. The mechanism analysis proposes a novel dual-pathway framework, demonstrating that LGFVs shareholding simultaneously enhances resource provision by reducing incentives for financial distress, and optimizes governance by strengthening monitoring capacity. Heterogeneity analysis further reveals that the governance effectiveness is particularly pronounced for LGFVs with higher administrative hierarchy or minority ownership concentration, whereas the effects are attenuated in state-owned firms and high-performing firms.

Keywords: Local government financing vehicles, Corporate Earnings Management, Resource Provision, Governance Optimization
