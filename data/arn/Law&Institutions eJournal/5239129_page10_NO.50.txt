Abstract

This study introduces a new theoretical framework proposing that artificial intelligence (AI) is fundamentally transforming how MD&A disclosures are written. Our AI-Induced Disclosure Pressure Model is supported by two empirical components. First, comparing our AI-based analysis of 108 MD&A reports from 27 S&P 100 firms (2021-2024) with Li's (2008) foundational work, we find similar relationships between tone and performance: negative and uncertainty tones are associated with lower profitability. However, unlike Li, we also find a negative relationship between positive tone and performance, suggesting that markets have adapted to strategic tone management. Second, fixed-effects regressions reveal that, once firm and year effects are controlled for, only uncertainty tone remains significantly associated with weaker fundamentals. This pattern indicates that firms have internalized the presence of algorithmic readers, maintaining upbeat language while inadvertently signaling poor performance through elevated uncertainty markers. The theoretical implication is critical: AI is no longer merely parsing disclosures post hoc, but actively reshaping how corporate narratives are crafted ex ante. This marks a shift from the overt obfuscation of the past to a subtler equilibrium, where firms write for both humans and algorithms, knowing that tone itself may now carry regulatory, reputational, and financial consequences.
