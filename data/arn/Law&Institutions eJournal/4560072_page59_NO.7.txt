Abstract

This study examines the impact of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) on stock returns for controversial companies. Using a sample period from 2010-2020, we find that market perception towards ESG investments by sinful firms has changed over time. Prior to 2015, stock market positively rewards ESG investments by firms, however, the ESG stock returns relationship turns negative post 2015. This could be due to the integration of ESG into market prices or could be that sinful firms’ investment in considered greenwashing. Moreover, we find the largest swing in market perception for firms in the oil and gas industry.

Keywords: esg, stock returns, controversial firms, market perception.
