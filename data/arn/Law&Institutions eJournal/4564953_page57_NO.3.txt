Abstract

A poison pill can increase firm value by providing management with more bargaining power or preserving tax benefits (value channel). It can also decrease firm value by entrenching the management and increasing agency costs (entrenchment channel). I examine how these two channels determine the market's reaction to poison pill adoptions by focusing on special cases when these channels are amplified or suppressed. I find that pre-existing defenses decrease the effect of the entrenchment channel for net operating loss (NOL) pill-adopting firms. A dual-class share structure greatly decreases the effect of the value channel for NOL pill-adopting firms. Leverage increases the effect of the value channel for defensive pill-adopting firms. Current advisory agency recommendations and most existing governance indices do not reflect these findings.

Keywords: poison pills, corporate governance, net operating losses
