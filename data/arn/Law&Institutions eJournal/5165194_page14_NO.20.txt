Abstract

We compare how sustainability-linked loans issued by U.S. and European borrowers change valuations around a major amendment to global sustainability-contracting guidelines. Loose U.S. federal regulations help us disentangle the effects of public and private interventions in sustainability performance. This private amendment increased the value of U.S. sustainability-linked loans over conventional loans, while European sustainability-linked loans were not affected by the amendment. Further, while both European and U.S. sustainability-linked loan issuers reduce carbon emissions after the private amendment, only U.S. borrowers do so without eroding financial performance. The amendment effect is stronger for U.S. firms without strict state climate rules and for those without European subsidiaries. Our findings highlight that private rule-setting can facilitate customized value-enhancing sustainability efforts that one-size-fits-all public regulations may not.  

Keywords: market-based rule, sustainability regulation, sustainability debt, loan contracting, carbon emission, market-based rule, sustainability regulation, sustainability debt, loan contracting, carbon emission
