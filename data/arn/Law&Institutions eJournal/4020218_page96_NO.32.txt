Abstract

Numerous editions of World Trade Organization (WTO) accords on trade-related intellectual property rights (TRIPS) are perceived in the pharmaceutical industry of India, although small and middle-sized pharmaceutical firms are progressively raising their product development, process expansion and research and development (R&D) potential. Close scrutiny of the disparity shows up a considerable distinction in the achieved results of sole ownership/partnership, private limited and public limited organizations versus product development, process advancements, extended purview of products and enterprises, magnitude of R&D, new concepts acceptance and adaptations. Factor assessment results exhibited that developing accredited intellectual property rights (IPR), technical steps and marketing practices elucidated 75% of variety. Approach commotion is prominent and SMEs are till now relying substantially on the government aid. Bhanot, A., & Kiran, R. (2013) (1) .
