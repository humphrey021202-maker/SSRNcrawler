Abstract

A growing literature finds that firms respond to anti-corruption laws by withdrawing from high-risk countries. Yet these laws prohibit bribery—not business—in such markets. This distinction opens the door to a more subtle response: firms may legally retain operations in risky regions while reducing the visibility of that exposure. Using the 2011 implementation of the U.K. Bribery Act as a regulatory shock, we show that exposed U.S. multinationals shift revenue disclosures from country-level to broader regional categories—particularly to high-risk regions—without altering the structure of their geographic disclosures. This reflects a strategic use of flexibility under existing reporting rules to comply formally while limiting transparency. Our findings reveal a potential regulatory disconnect: when laws strengthen but disclosure rules remain permissive, firms can obscure risk exposures without violating either regime. This decoupling of legal compliance from public visibility highlights the importance of aligning regulations and, in this specific case, strengthens the argument for mandating more granular geographic disclosures.

Keywords: Anti-corruption laws, exposure, reporting, U.K. Bribery Act
