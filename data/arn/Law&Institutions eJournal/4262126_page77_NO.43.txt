Abstract

This paper examines stock market reactions to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives. Using a dataset of news releases on CSR activities that companies voluntarily report, I find that cumulative abnormal returns around the news day average out to zero, while the variation is substantial. Market reactions are favorable if firms address issues frequently discussed and choose methods for effectively handling issues. Although the paper does not exclude the potential for CSR initiatives to be reported as virtue signaling, it demonstrates that public needs for CSR play a role in influencing the valuation of CSR initiatives.

Keywords: Corporate Social Responsibility

JEL Classification: M14, G12, G14, L21
