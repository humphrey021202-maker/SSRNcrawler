Abstract

We investigate how firms respond to intensified product market competition by redesigning their incentive contracts with their CFOs. Using large tariff cuts as exogenous shocks, we find that firms experiencing higher product market competition pressures will grant fewer risk-taking incentives to their CFOs while keeping pay-performance grants relatively constant. Moreover, firms that have more binding financial constraints or higher financial risk exhibit a stronger tendency to reduce risk-taking grants to their CFOs. Despite the increased risk environment following the intensified competition, we find that the volatilities of the influenced firms fall following the decrease of risk-taking incentives for the CFOs.

Keywords: Compensation Incentives, Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Product Market Competition, Risk-taking, Financial Constraints, Corporate Governance
