Abstract

This paper investigates how resolution time affects firms under Chapter 11 protection. We find a robust negative association between a firm’s resolution time and its probability of emergence, using several controls for endogeneity. The probability of emergence reduces by 0.6% for each month (or 7.2% for a year) spent in bankruptcy. Firms filing during recessions have a lower likelihood of emergence. Conditional upon business cycles, the explanatory power of various determinants such as firm size, pre-packaged or pre-negotiated bankruptcy and industry are found to be different. During economic recessions, firm size and pre-packaged or pre-negotiated filings have no significant impact on the probability of emergence.

Keywords: Chapter 11 bankruptcy, Restructuring, and endogeneity
