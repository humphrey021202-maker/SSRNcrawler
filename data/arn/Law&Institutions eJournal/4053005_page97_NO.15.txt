Abstract

We study executive pay cuts during the Covid crisis, a phenomenon called “sharing the pain.” We find that both economic and stakeholder considerations are associated with executive pay cuts during the pandemic. We also study the timing of executive equity awards during the pandemic and find that (a) the likelihood of executives receiving unscheduled grants rose significantly, (b) managers who cut their pay were 1.5 times more likely to receive unscheduled grants, and (c) the unscheduled grants appear opportunistically timed. On average, executives whose pay was cut gained $444,774 per unscheduled grant within 60 trading days of the award grant date. As a counterexample to the COVID-19 pandemic, we re-examine executive pay cut decisions and the timing of equity awards following the September 11, 2001, terror attacks, when stakeholder concerns were less salient. Our findings suggest that substantial gains from the timing of stock and option grants offset executives’ sharing of the pain during crises.

Keywords: sharing the pain, stakeholder capitalism, executive compensation, executive option and stock grant timing, 9/11 terrorist attacks, COVID-19 crisis

JEL Classification: J33, J63, M14
