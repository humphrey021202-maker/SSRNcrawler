Abstract

We examine the implications of NGO activism around the world using novel data on NGO allegations about misleading or false corporate environmental and social claims (“E&S-washing”). These NGO campaigns primarily target large, visible firms in the consumer-facing or oil and gas industries, focusing predominantly on statements on how firms impact climate change, consumer health, and waste. NGOs target E&S-washing in customer-focused disclosures like advertisements, product labels, and packaging. Stocks react with negative announcement returns to NGO allegations, especially when the alleged behavior concerns financially-material E issues. Negative media coverage also rises. NGO campaigns have real effects: Firms criticized for climate-related claims reduce their Scope 1 emissions, but this effect comes with a simultaneous emissions increase in the supply chain. The corporate response arises, at least partially, because NGOs catalyze engagement by institutional investors.




Keywords: Sustainability disclosure, Greenwashing, ESG, NGOs, Carbon emissions
