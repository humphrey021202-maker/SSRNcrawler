Abstract

We exploit exogenous shocks to institutional investors' portfolios to show that managers engage in significantly more stakeholder-related misconduct when institutional investors are distracted. The relationship is more pronounced (i) for firms where managers are more enticed to commit misconduct or have more outside options in the executive labor market, (ii) for firms in competitive environments, and (iii) for firms with weak internal and external governance. Finally, we find that during these periods of institutional distraction, managers are particularly likely to engage in misconduct detrimental to employees.

Keywords: corporate governance, institutional investors, misconduct, career concerns, corporate social responsibility
