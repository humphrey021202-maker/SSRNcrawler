Abstract

Classification shifting is a low-cost earnings management tool wherein firms misclassify some of the items in their financial statements to inflate their core accounting numbers. Though classification shifting works as a substitute to accrual and real earnings management, it may face limited scrutiny of regulators and auditors Nelson et al. (2002) as there is no alteration in GAAP figures. We examine firms’ misclassification activity and its association with temporal changes in investor sentiment. We find that firms are more likely to lower their classification shifting activity in a high sentiment quarter relative to a lower one. The results remain consistent for alternate sentiment proxies as well. Our findings will not only have theoretical contributions but may have practical implications too for investors, auditors, and regulators.
