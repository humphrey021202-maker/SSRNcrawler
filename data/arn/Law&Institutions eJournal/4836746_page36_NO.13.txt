Abstract

Managing right level of capital structure plays a key role in short term and long-term financial decision-making process for any firms irrespective of industries across the world. Capital Structure is one of the key concepts in academic literature of Corporate Finance. Capital Structure tells firm's internal stakeholders like managers about financial position to take several decisions like investment for future projects, to adopt cost optimization techniques or this even gives some financial well-being news to external stakeholders like investors. There are many theoretical and empirical studies on future profit analysis, earnings per share predictions etc. based on some machine learning algorithms but there are very few advanced analytics and machine learning studies on prediction on firms' decision on changing capital structure in future. I selected a stratified sample of 51 USA firms from different industries like Manufacturing, Automobiles, Technology, Food, Airlines etc. and develop machine learning algorithm on 2017-2024 financial 10-K report data to predict firm's future year decision on possibility of changing capital structure. I choose 600+ financial parameters which might affect decision on future capital structure change and then evaluate top 10 most influencing parameters. My benchmark analysis with theoretical random work model and existing ML model shows higher accuracy in prediction over existing work. Due to selection of large number of parameters and iterative removal of redundant parameters my model works very well compared to existing models. My model describes the analytics of several capital structure influencing financial parameters in overall USA markets during pre and post Covid time which makes distinctive work than other studies.

Keywords: Capital Structure Prediction, Corporate Finance, Machine Learning, Advanced Analytics, XBRL Data, Random Forest
