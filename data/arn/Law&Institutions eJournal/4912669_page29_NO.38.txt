Abstract

This paper examines the impact of Refinitiv's revised ESG scoring methodology in 2020, which penalizes firms neglecting sustainability reporting, on corporate ESG practices. Firms with large negative ESG score revisions show significant improvements in their scores post-adjustment, reflected in sub-scores and scores from other providers. They achieve this by professionalizing ESG disclosures and processes, including introducing sustainability reports, establishing CSR committees, and participating in ESG surveys. There are, however, signs that these trends started already prior to Refinitiv's scoring adjustment. Firms with positive ESG score revisions, in contrast, have established ESG disclosures but tend to have higher carbon emissions, even though they improve their carbon intensity subsequently.

Keywords: ESG ratings, ESG methodology, ESG disclosure, ESG initiatives, Sustainable Finance
