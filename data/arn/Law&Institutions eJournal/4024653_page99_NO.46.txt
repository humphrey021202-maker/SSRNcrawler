Abstract

We test whether rare and extreme changes in financing policies --- switching to (from) debt financing --- has real implications on shareholder value conditional on institutional quality. Using a large firm-level dataset from 53 countries over the period 1981---2019, we find that switching to (from) debt financing is value-dehancing (value-enhancing). We further find that such changes in shareholder value are more (less) pronounced for firms in countries with low (high) institutional quality. Further tests also suggest that our results are robust to controlling for other determinants of firm value, including fixed effects, using other model specifications, sub-sampling and alternative proxies of institutional quality and changes in financial policies. Overall our findings suggest that institutional quality affects the contentious relationship between shareholder value and financing policies.

Keywords: Peer effects, Working capital management, Governance quality, Financial development, Shareholder value, Cross-country study
