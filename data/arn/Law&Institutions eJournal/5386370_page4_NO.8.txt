Abstract

EthicsMeter 4.0 introduces a dynamic framework to quantify ethical harm in digital systems. It combines exploitative design metrics, passive infrastructure impact, mental and relational damage indicators, and culture-specific vulnerability coefficients into a unified scoring formula. This enables cross-domain ethical diagnostics, helping platforms, researchers, and policymakers address harm with measurable insight.
