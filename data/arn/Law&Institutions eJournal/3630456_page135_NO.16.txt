Abstract

This article will provide insights on the implications of merger legislation on corporate debt restructuring. Thus, apart from the analysis of competition legislation surrounding mergers, it also includes a brief analysis of the restructuring process during which the failing firm may be invoked if it is decided that the means of viability of the firm are through a merger/acquisition.

Keywords: Mergers, bankruptcy, restructuring.
