Abstract

I experimentally examine how company managers, especially those who feel powerful, get aggressive reporting past their primary impediment: external auditors. Specifically, I examine whether managers’ strategies for selecting audit evidence for aggressive reporting are biased and whether more powerful-feeling managers follow these strategies to a greater extent. I posit that managers follow two strategies to get more aggressive reporting past auditors: (1) providing high proportions of less reliable (i.e., trustworthy) evidence and (2) excluding context for evidence that casts doubt on its reliability. Across two experiments, I show that managers alter evidence quality following these two strategies when reporting is more aggressive. Consistent with my expectations, I also find that the increased use of the first strategy, in particular, is amplified by more powerful-feeling managers. These insights should help auditors and regulators identify ways to improve audit evidence quality, which ultimately reduces the likelihood that troublingly aggressive reporting reaches investors.

Keywords: aggressive reporting; audit evidence; audit quality; earnings management; evidence evaluation; power., audit evidence, power, earnings management, audit quality, evidence evaluation
