Abstract

Responding to the International Accounting Standards Board’s (IASB) call for an empirical evaluation, this study examines the effectiveness of IFRS 16 through its impact on investor equity risk reassessments following the adoption of the new lease accounting standard. Specifically, we examine whether, and under what conditions, the enhanced lease reporting mandated under IFRS 16 generates asymmetric incremental informational effects in capital markets. Using a panel of 10,373 firm-year observations from Canadian public companies over the period 2011–2024, we find that IFRS 16 significantly alters investor perceptions of equity risk, particularly for firms with weaker financial strength, higher information uncertainty, greater investor trading intensity, and more complex lease portfolios. These results highlight how firm-specific characteristics shape the standard’s informational impact. Our study contributes to the literature by documenting heterogeneous capital market responses to IFRS 16 and providing practical insights for standard setters and investors on when the enhanced lease transparency most effectively improves information-based equity risk assessments in today’s increasingly data-driven capital markets.

Keywords: IFRS 16, Equity Risk Reassessment, Financial Strength, Information Uncertainty, Investor Trading Intensity, Lease Portfolio Complexity
