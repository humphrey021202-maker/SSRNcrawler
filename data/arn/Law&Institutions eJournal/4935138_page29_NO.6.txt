Abstract

We find that director interlocking significantly reduces stock price crash risk. We further demonstrate that the effect of director interlocking on stock price crash risk is more pronounced in an opaque environment and for firms that are subject to high information asymmetry, low product market competition, weak corporate governance, and less external monitoring. Collectively, our findings support the monitoring view which stipulates that interlocked directors can leverage the information flow from their directorate network to effectively mitigate manager’s bad news hoarding, which, in turn, alleviates stock price crash risk. This study provides important insights to shareholders and nomination committee members in making decisions about appointing directors to the board by demonstrating that interlocked directors can work as a control mechanism to restrain managerial bad news hoarding.

Keywords: director interlocking, social network, crash risk
