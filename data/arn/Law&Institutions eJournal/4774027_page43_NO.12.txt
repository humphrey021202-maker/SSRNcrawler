Abstract

We exploit a governance reform enacted in Brazil to examine whether CEO non-duality influences earnings management. Employing recent developments in the difference-in-differences methodology, we find that firms mandated to separate CEO-chairman roles reduced their discretionary accruals while keeping real activities unchanged, suggesting an improvement in financial reporting quality. Effects are concentrated in larger firms and those exhibiting higher pre-reform levels of discretionary accruals. Our findings are policy-relevant as they underscore that a coercive CEO-chairman separation may emerge as a key mechanism in corporate governance, capable of mitigating agency problems by curbing managerial opportunism associated with earnings manipulation.

Keywords: G32, G34, G38, M40 Earnings management, CEO duality, corporate governance reform
