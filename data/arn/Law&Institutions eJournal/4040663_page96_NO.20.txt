Abstract

I investigate how firms respond to reduced private equity buyout activity in their home states by exploiting the state-by-state adoption of laws that increase the cost of buyouts. I find evidence suggestive of reduced firm efficiency. The firms also become less likely to go bankrupt or to relocate to other states. These findings suggest that the firms' managers may be starting to enjoy the quiet life. I also find a reduction in layoffs. Overall, the results indicate a trade-off: Whereas reduced private equity buyout activity increases managerial entrenchment, it also lowers firm exits and strengthens employees' job security.

Keywords: Private Equity, Buyout Activity, Market for Corporate Control, Corporate Governance

JEL Classification: G34, K22
