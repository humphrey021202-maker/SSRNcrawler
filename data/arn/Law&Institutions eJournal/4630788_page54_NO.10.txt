Abstract

This study examines the global–local corporate social responsibility (CSR) interface in the context of Confucian culture by analyzing four multinational corporation (MNC) subsidiaries in China. We collect both primary data via 18 in-depth interviews and secondary data. Our findings suggest that, driven by the need for internal and external legitimacy, these China-based MNC subsidiaries simultaneously implement global and local CSR practices while adhering to the overarching global CSR strategy formulated by headquarters. Confucianism impacts the social dimensions of CSR practices during local implementation. It also acts as a catalyst for accelerating global CSR efforts and tailoring specific local CSR practices, leading to “glocalization” via a “reconciliation” mechanism, while hindering global CSR initiatives through an “interference” mechanism. Our research carries valuable implications for CSR practitioners operating within the MNC framework.

Keywords: corporate social responsibility (CSR), multinational corporations (MNCs), Confucianism, global, local, case study
