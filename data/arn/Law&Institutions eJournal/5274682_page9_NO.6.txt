Abstract

Public companies face escalating requirements to disclose cybersecurity risks and damages in regulatory filings. In theory, such disclosures should equip investors with knowledge required to make informed decisions, while also encouraging firms to adopt more robust strategies for managing cybersecurity risks. In practice, discussions are often embedded in disparate locations of long documents full of legalese, which hinders systematic examination. This paper examines the regulatory filings of 45 firms that experienced ransomware incidents between 2018 and 2021. We describe a process whereby 6,282 cyber-related statements were extracted from 249 10-K filings between 2018–23, then categorized using an iterative process inspired by grounded theory. We then perform quantitative and qualitative analysis of the statements, examining how firms discuss cybersecurity before and after experiencing an incident.

Keywords: cybersecurity metrics, security economics, cybersecurity regulation, 10-K disclosure
