Abstract

This study is on board characteristics and Audit quality of listed firms in nigeria: the moderating role of audit committee gender. It is neccessitated by the need to curb financial losses and corporate failures through reliable, true and fair value financial information disclosures for stakeholders in the corporate world.

Data sourced from the published accounts of these firms displayed on their websites and from the Nigerian Exchange Group was analysed using multiregression analysis aided by STATA statistical software to accommodate the multivariate variables. Findings of the study provide evidence that board characteristics affect audit quality particularly the inclusion of women on the board through gender diversity.
