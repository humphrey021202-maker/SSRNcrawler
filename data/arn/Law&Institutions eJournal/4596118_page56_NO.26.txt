Abstract

This study investigates whether and how corporate social responsibility (CSR) affects stock liquidity. Empirical findings suggest that CSR facilitates an uplift in stock liquidity. The research further reveals that media coverage and corporate operations are crucial channels for CSR to affect stock liquidity, with the former playing a more dominant role. Notably, the bolstering effect of CSR on stock liquidity is amplified during periods of increasing economic policy uncertainty. Heterogeneity analysis shows that state-owned enterprises are notably influenced by CSR's effect on stock liquidity.  Among CSR subcategories, shareholder responsibility has a distinct impact on liquidity.

Keywords: CSR, Stock liquidity, Economic policy uncertainty, Media coverage
