Abstract

This study investigates the effects of public sector audits on California's budgetary discipline and fiscal accountability. The analysis combines a quantitative analysis of budget and overspended metrics with historical reviews of audit records by approaching a mixed methods approach. The findings suggest that agencies with complex service delivery systems (Health Services and Corrections) experienced more severe audit findings, lower post-audit correction rates, and higher overspending levels than regulatory agencies. Graphical analyses supported these trends, demonstrating how operational complexity impacts audit and compliance success. The paper highlights the importance of timely audit follow-ups and structured internal controls in furtherance of public financial accountability. Recommendations are proposed for strengthening audit intervention strategies and promoting risk-based financial governance models in the public sector.

Keywords: Public Audits, State Budget Oversight, Accountability, California Government, Audit Performance
