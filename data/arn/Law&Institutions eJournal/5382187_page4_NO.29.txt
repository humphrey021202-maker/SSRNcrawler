Abstract

We examine how capital markets and corporate insiders respond to the SEC's 2022 amendments to Rule 10b5-1, which governs pre-scheduled insider trading plans. Prompted by concerns that insiders exploited plans to trade on nonpublic information, the reforms introduced enhanced disclosure and restrictions on plan adoption and execution. We find that markets react positively to the rule's adoption, especially for firms whose officers and directors sold frequently or profitably under 10b5-1. The response is stronger for firms whose insiders exhibit 10b5-1 trading behaviors targeted by the rule-such as short cooling-off periods or trades shortly before earnings announcements-and becomes especially pronounced in response to the SEC's first 10b5-1 enforcement action. We observe a sharp decline in 10b5-1 trading volume and profitability, and changes in firm-level insider trading policy following amendment proposal and implementation. Overall, the findings suggest that targeted regulation and enforcement can deter opportunistic trading and enhance shareholder value.

Keywords: Rule 10b5-1, Regulation, Enforcement
