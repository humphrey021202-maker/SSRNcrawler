Abstract

We provide causal evidence on how banks respond to more stringent capital requirements. We study the reaction to a regulatory change restricting US banks with more than $15 billion in total assets from including Trust-Preferred Securities (TruPS) in Tier 1 capital. Using a regression discontinuity design, we show that banks just above the $15 billion threshold lowered their reported Tier 1 capital and total consolidated assets for every year from 2014 to 2018. Collectively, our findings show that tighter capital requirements caused affected banks to shrink in size.

Keywords: capital requirements, trust-preferred securities, bank balance sheet
