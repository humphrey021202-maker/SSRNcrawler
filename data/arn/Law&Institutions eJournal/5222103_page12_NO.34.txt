Abstract

Using a voluntary audit reform in Sweden in 2010 as an exogenous shift in auditing regulation for micro firms, we investigate how voluntary audits affect corporate tax avoidance. Our research shows that two commonly used measures of corporate tax avoidance (taxes paid scaled by lagged total assets and a measure of conforming tax avoidance scaled by lagged total assets) are fundamentally flawed if used to investigate regulation changes that are related to firm size such as in the Swedish reform. The reason is that smaller firms in most cases grow faster than large ones in their efforts to reach minimum efficient scale. As such, both these measures will exhibit a negative trend as firms grow, and the trend for smaller firms will in most cases be more negative than for larger ones, creating a false appearance of reduced tax payments and increased tax avoidance over time, even if the tax payments as a share of profits (the tax-base) remain unchanged. We also show that an often-used alternative measure of corporate tax avoidance, the cash-effective tax rate, does not suffer this flaw as it instead scales tax payments by profits.

Keywords: Tax evasion, regulatory reform, earnings management, placebo testing, conditional difference-in-difference analysis
