Abstract

I examine whether and how ESG transparency affects investment efficiency. Exploiting the staggered coverage of LSEG ESG ratings (previously Thomson Reuters Asset4) as an exogenous shock that increases ESG transparency, I uncover a reduction in investment-q sensitivity, indicating lower investment efficiency after coverage initiation. Consistent with reduced managerial learning, I show that greater ESG transparency improves price informativeness for emissions but crowds out fundamental information from the stock price, as managers solicit less feedback from market reaction to capex forecasts. The decline in investment efficiency is more pronounced among firms with higher initial ownership by ESG fund, whose trading crowds out fundamental information. Consistent with managers deviating from shareholder value maximization, I find that firms increase environmental investments while reducing regular investments following the shock. Due to increased scrutiny, firms with poorer initial environmental performance experience larger reductions in investment efficiency. Overall, the results suggest that more ESG transparency impairs real efficiency by constraining managerial learning and driving firms’ objectives away from maximizing shareholder value.

Keywords: ESG transparency, investment efficiency, managerial learning, shareholder value maximization
