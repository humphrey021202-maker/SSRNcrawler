Abstract

Bankruptcy experience in managers’ prior careers is associated with increased firm’s hedging activities, especially when such an experience is more recent or occurs when the manager is in an executive role. Robust estimates with firm-fixed effects and matched sample analyses suggest that this evidence is unlikely to be driven by endogenous manager-firm matching. Compared to peers, bankruptcy-experienced managers’ hedging strategy adversely affects firm performance. The adverse impact of managers’ bankruptcy experience is more pronounced in firms with weaker corporate governance. Our evidence implies that managerial biases induced by prior bankruptcy experience can shape corporate hedging and have shareholder value implications.

Keywords: Corporate hedging, Risk management, Cash flow hedging, CEO, Bankruptcy experience

JEL Classification: G30; G32; G34
