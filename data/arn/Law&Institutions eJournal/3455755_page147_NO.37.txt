Abstract

Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) are a vital support to the effective management of organisations in all sectors. The focus of this study is the role CFOs play in non-profit organisations. Non-profits have unique features impinging on CFOs’ roles. The study analysed interviews with 15 non-profit CFOs, drawing on role theory. Participants’ role perceptions clustered around four significant themes: protector, supporter, innovator and strategist. The protector role tended to moderate an innovator role so innovations attempted were low risk. Those who embraced innovation tended to be strategists. Challenges non-profit CFOs faced owing to the unique features of their sector were found to influence role perceptions and lead to role conflicts and extra-role activities.

Keywords: Accountants, CFO, Extra-role, Non-profit, Role conflict
