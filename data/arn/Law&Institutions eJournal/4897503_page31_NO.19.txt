Abstract

In this cross-country study, we examine whether domestic and foreign ownership affect the dividend payout decision. In particular, we study the ownership structure of 221 banks across 31 European countries during the period 2007 to 2021. Using a unique database, combining ownership information from different data sources, we provide new evidence regarding the relationship between the dividend policy of European banks and their ownership nationality structure. Supporting the agency cost theory, our findings suggest that nationality matters and that different shareholders impact bank’s payout policy differently. We find a strong positive relationship between dividend payout and domestic ownership concentration, and, a negative relationship between dividend payout and foreign ownership concentration. Our findings offer relevant insights for regulators, investors and a broad set of European Banks stakeholders.

Keywords: payout policy, ownership concentration, dividend payout
