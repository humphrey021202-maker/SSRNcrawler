Abstract

This research explores the differences between International Accounting Standard Board (IASB) standards and the Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Institutions (AAOIFI) standards in the accounting treatment of Islamic financial products such as Murabaha, Ijarah, Musharaka, and Mudharaba. To achieve this objective, the study employs a qualitative method by surveying literature, classical fiqh, and financial statements of Islamic banks that adopted the IASB and AAOIFI standards in Malaysia and Bahrain respectively.
Under the AAOIFI standards i.e. Financial Accounting Standards (FAS), Murabaha transactions are always treated as trading transactions, with the selling institution recognizing receivables and revenue in its financial statements. Costs related to the sale are disclosed separately in the notes to the financial statements. In contrast, the IASB’s International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) allows for recognition as a financial asset, recognizing revenue over the credit period. Both IFRS and FAS recognize the importance of control and influence in the accounting treatment of Musharaka investments. However, FAS’s approach is more aligned with the principles of Islamic finance, ensuring that profits and losses are recognized based on actual distribution or deduction from the investment capital. FAS requires that lessors continue to recognize leased assets on their balance sheet, reflecting the ownership of the asset while recognizing income related to the lease. In contrast, IFRS allows for derecognition of the underlying asset, treating the lease as a finance lease.
The differences between IFRS and FAS in the accounting treatment of Islamic financial products highlight the challenge of applying global accounting standards to transactions governed by Shariah principles. While some differences can be mitigated through enhanced disclosures, significant disparities in recognition and presentation remain. Efforts towards harmonization should focus on revising FAS standards to align more closely with global norms without compromising Shariah compliance. This approach aims to enhance transparency, comparability, and international acceptance of financial statements prepared by Islamic financial institutions under both frameworks.
This study contributes to the literature by providing updated insights into the evolving standards of IFRS and FAS, particularly in the context of Islamic finance. It underscores the ongoing need for dialogue and convergence efforts between standard setters to bridge existing gaps and improve the financial reporting landscape for Islamic financial institutions globally.
