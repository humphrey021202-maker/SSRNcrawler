Abstract

Reproducibility and replicability underpin the credibility of scientific research, yet finance has only recently engaged with concerns that dominate other disciplines. This study presents the first systematic evidence on how finance scholars perceive the reproducibility and replicability of their field. Drawing on a global survey of 938 researchers, we find that respondents estimate 53% of published finance studies to be reproducible and 60% replicable, highlighting both progress and concern. Irreproducibility is viewed as stemming primarily from poor documentation, restricted data, and limited transparency, while replication failures are attributed to selective reporting, data mining, and incentive structures that reward significance over robustness. Respondents strongly support journal enforcement of data and code sharing, enhanced methodological training, and professional incentives for replication studies. Although concerns remain, many perceive gradual improvement in research reliability. These findings indicate that problems are structural rather than fraudulent, and that durable gains in credibility will depend on systemic reforms aligning transparency with professional rewards. The study benchmarks perceptions within finance and contributes to the broader discourse on research integrity.

Keywords: reproduction, replication, perceptions
