Abstract

This paper examines the relation between corporate social responsibility (CSR) performance and tax-motivated income shifting. Using a profit-shifting measure estimated from multinational enterprises (MNEs) data, we find that parent firms with higher CSR scores shift significantly more profits to their low-tax foreign subsidiaries. Overall, our evidence suggests that MNEs engaging in CSR activities acquire legitimacy and moral capital that temper negative responses by stakeholders and thus have greater scope and chance to engage in unethical profit-shifting activities, consistent with the legitimacy theory.

Keywords: Corporate Social Responsibility; Legitimacy Theory; Risk Management; Profit Shifting; Corporate Tax Systems; Agency Problems
