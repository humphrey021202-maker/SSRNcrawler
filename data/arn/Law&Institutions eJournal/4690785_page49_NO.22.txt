Abstract

This paper conducts an empirical analysis using data from Chinese listed companies to examine the impact of excessive executive compensation on corporate ESG performance. The study finds a "reverse U-shaped" relationship between excessive executive compensation and corporate ESG performance: as executive compensation increases, ESG performance initially improves but tends to decline beyond a certain threshold. Furthermore, the academic background of executives plays a significant moderating role in this relationship. The mechanism of action between excessive executive compensation and corporate ESG performance includes the paths of corporate green innovation ability and environmental information disclosure.

Keywords: ESG performance, Excessive executive compensation, Academic experience, Green innovation, environmental information disclosure
