Abstract

This study examines how investment tax provisions affect firm risk-taking. Leveraging quasi-experimental variation in accelerated depreciation schedules created by U.S. bonus depreciation provisions, I implement a generalized Difference-in-Differences framework and find that firms increase risk in response. Tests of the underlying economic mechanism show that the risk-taking effects are concentrated among financially constrained firms, indicating that bonus depreciation provisions alleviate financial frictions. Robustness checks, including event study and placebo treatment designs, validate the identification strategy. These findings highlight the role of bonus depreciation provisions in shaping firm risk preferences and provide insights for informed debates on corporate tax policy.

Keywords: bonus depreciation, financial frictions, risk-taking, taxation, tax provisions

JEL Classification: D22, G32, H25, H32
