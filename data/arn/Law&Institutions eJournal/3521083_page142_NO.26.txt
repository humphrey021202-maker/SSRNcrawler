Independent

Date Written: June 04, 2019

Abstract

The role of the manager in maximization of shareholder profitability has led several corporations to fail. To counter such corporate failures, corporate governance mechanisms have been incorporated that realign the diverse interests of the corporate managers by assigning independent non-executive directors. Corporate governance has grown significant in importance since the global financial crisis that led many economies into recession and turmoil.

Keywords: chenoy ceil, consult corporates, shareholder, profitability
