Abstract

According to recent media accounts businesses are increasingly engaging in corporate political activism (CPA), actions in support of a given side of politically charged issues. Evidence from peer-reviewed research, however, shows that CPA does not help companies. In fact, it can harm them in several ways, damaging their brand equity, employee productivity, and financial performance as well as alienating some customers. We have developed a strategic framework that business executives can use to assess where their company stands in its CPA journey and determine its path forward. This framework is built upon four strategies: convergence, divergence, selective engagement, and apolitical support. Company leaders can use this framework to evaluate whether and how they should engage in activism and to find ways to shape their political strategy over time.

Keywords: corporate political activism, politics, CEO activism, corporate social responsibility, ESG, governance

JEL Classification: M
