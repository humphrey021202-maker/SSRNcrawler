Abstract

Shareholder voting on Say-on-Pay reveals investors' preferences about optimal CEO pay. Studying these preferences is complicated by the proxy advisor's recommendations on each vote. Contrary to recent evidence that combines votes with recommendations, we separate these two actions and find that investors put a large weight on CEO contract pay level and incentives pay components. These results are even stronger for institutional investors. Our findings highlight that CEO contracts, not just firm performance, are central to how investors evaluate and monitor executive compensation.

Keywords: Shareholder Voting, Shareholder monitoring, ISS, Corporate Governance, CEO Contract. JEL Codes: G34, G30
