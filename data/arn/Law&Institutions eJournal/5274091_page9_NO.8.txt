Abstract

This paper focuses on two representative companies in the oil and gas sector-PetroChina and BP-to compare their ESG disclosure practices. PetroChina, a state-owned enterprise in China, follows the Shanghai Stock Exchange's ESG requirements, primarily publishing independent sustainability reports. In contrast, BP, listed on the London Stock Exchange, integrates TCFD-aligned content into its annual reports and adheres to international standards such as GRI. Despite operating in similar high-carbon industries and facing comparable climate and transition pressures, the two firms differ significantly in ownership structure, market environment, and regulatory context, resulting in divergent ESG disclosure practices. This study analyzes their approaches across content, regulatory framework, and thematic focus, and interprets the differences through the lenses of Institutional Theory, Resource Dependence Theory, and Stakeholder Theory. The findings aim to shed light on how institutional and market forces jointly shape corporate ESG behavior, providing both theoretical insight and practical implications for improving ESG strategy and disclosure standards.

Keywords: ESG disclosure, PetroChina, BP, China-UK institutional environment comparison, TCFD
