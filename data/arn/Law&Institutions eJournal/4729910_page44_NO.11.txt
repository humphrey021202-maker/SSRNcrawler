Abstract

This paper introduces a new composite risk measurement framework to assess the impact of firms’ corporate governance on their capital market performance. By integrating traditional and innovative risk metrics, including a Hybrid Variance metric, this framework offers a more nuanced understanding of the dynamic relationship between corporate governance structures and capital market performance. It aims to bridge methodological gaps in existing literature, providing academic enrichment and practical tools for evaluating governance practices’ risk implications on capital market performance. Future empirical studies can apply this framework and evaluate the overall risk exposures of publicly listed companies from the corporate-governance-capital-market-nexus perspective.

Keywords: composite risk measurement, hybrid variance, corporate governance, capital market performance

JEL Classification: G10, G30, G32
