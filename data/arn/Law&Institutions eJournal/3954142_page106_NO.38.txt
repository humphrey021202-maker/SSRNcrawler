Abstract

In this paper, we study shareholder views on corporate political contributions. We find that, with shareholders’ explicit approval, firms are more likely to have higher corporate political contribution, measured by the amount of donations to the US political parties in the next election cycle. Firm’s political contribution also have a positive long-run impact on firm valuations. When analysing firm’s political ideology, we find weak evidence that Democratic party may benefit more from this shareholder’s support than Republican party, particularly in case of firms which have recently switched their political ideology to Democratic party. Our results show that shareholders’ explicit approval has an impact on firm’s engagement of political activities and imply that if the shareholders stand on the same side of the firms, firms are more likely to engage in politically-related corporate activities. Our key results are supported in a regression discontinuity design and are robust to two-way clustered standard errors.

Keywords: Shareholder Proposals, Corporate Political Activities, Regression Discontinuity
