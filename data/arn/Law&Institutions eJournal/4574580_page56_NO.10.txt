Abstract

We use top managers’ linguistic features in the earnings call to identify corporate moral values, the set of values and norms that drive moral reasoning within the corporation. Our analysis reveals significant heterogeneity among public corporations in the United States in their emphasis on universalist and communal moral values. We also show that corporate morality is correlated with several corporate policies, such as the decision to operate in a foreign market, the treatment of employees, the environmental performance, and the distribution of dividends. We next use establishment-level data to identify the impact corporate moral values have on employment policies using the 2007-2008 financial crisis as a laboratory experiment. Our results indicate that firms with a predominant communal morality are less likely to cut employment when there is a high degree of social relationship between the employees and managers.

Keywords: Moral Values, Corporate Policies
