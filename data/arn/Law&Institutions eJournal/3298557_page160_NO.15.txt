Abstract

We examine the impact of China's National Intellectual Property Strategy (NIPS) reform on U.S. firms’ innovation. Strengthened IP rights in China incentivize U.S. multinationals to protect their Chinese market profits from potential misappropriation by domestic rivals. Consequently, firms exposed to NIPS face increased litigation and, when litigated as defendants, significantly reduce patenting and focus more on incremental innovation. While these strategies minimize future litigation, they result in greater product homogeneity and heightened market competition. Overall, we show that U.S. multinationals play a key role in transferring regulatory shocks from emerging economies to U.S. markets, underscoring the importance of global business integration for corporate innovation policies.

Keywords: China's Intellectual Property Reform, NIPS, Inter-firm patent litigation, Intellectual property rights boundary and product market dynamics, Innovation activity, Innovation strategy
