Abstract

We establish a link between disperse ownership and firms' political participation and show that this link helps explain why corporations make relatively small political contributions despite such contributions' large firm-value benefits. Because even large firm-level benefits from political participation become insignificant for shareholders with small equity stakes, many shareholders refrain from making political contributions. As a result, corporate PACs' ability to raise funds is limited by personal financial incentives of individual shareholders. Using legislators' sudden deaths for identification, we show that disperse ownership introduces a quantitatively large wedge between firm-level and shareholder-level returns from making campaign contributions. Our estimates imply that shareholder-level returns from making campaign contributions are 600 times smaller than firm-level returns, explaining why many shareholders refrain from contributing. We also document that that financial incentives of individual contributors are a strong determinant of their political contributions.

Keywords: PACs, Political Contributions, Corporate Political Influence
