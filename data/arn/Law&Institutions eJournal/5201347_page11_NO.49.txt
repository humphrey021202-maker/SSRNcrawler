Abstract

We find that introducing the General Counsel (GC) position in top management significantly curtails mispricing-induced investment without constraining investment motivated by growth opportunities, suggesting GC’s pivotal role in mitigating investment distortion. Such an effect is not observed when a new GC replaced an incumbent GC who voluntarily left the position, thereby not just attributable to the manager fixed effect but largely to the position fixed effect. Moreover, introducing the GC position in top management and the resulting change in investment has led to decreases in return volatility and increases in future stock returns. We further show that GC in top management lowers the likelihood of firms engaging in overpricing-driven R&D investment and M&As. Finally, GC effectively reduces potential lawsuits triggered by aggressive investment. Collectively, our results suggest that having the GC position in top management enhances investment quality by curbing mispricing-driven investment, attributable to the position’s conservative or risk-averse nature.

Keywords: Corporate investment, general counsel, investment distortion, top management team
