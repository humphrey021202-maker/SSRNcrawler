Abstract

Activists push firms to improve their environmental and social (ES) performance using shareholder proposals. These ES proposals threaten managerial legitimacy and control, so management argues against activists to deflect their threat. We examine  how activists and management use rhetorical strategies in proxy statements to persuade shareholders to vote for or against ES proposals. Drawing on Aristotle’s On Rhetoric, we study how appeals to ethos, logos, and pathos persuade proxy advisors and shareholders. We utilize natural language processing to develop measures for each type of appeal, which we use to examine 1,708 ES shareholder proposals in 1,055 proxy statements from 2007 to 2021. We use Heckman models to adjust for the endogenous activist targeting, which we expect to induce management rhetoric. Rhetorical strategies by activists and management are associated with proxy advisor recommendations and shareholder votes in support of each side, and affect votes incremental to the proxy advisors’ recommendations.

Keywords: ESG, proxy voting, rhetoric, textual analysis, natural language processing JEL code: G34, G38, K22, M14, M48
