Abstract

Virtually everyone agrees that a well-run, ethically responsible business pays all employees fair wages that are gender neutral. In other words, equal work results in equal pay, regardless of gender. Corporate management, including internal auditors, can help corporations in their efforts to achieve gender equality and other socially responsible goals. Corporate social responsibility is a major issue in modern business. The idea is that corporations should do their part to make the world a better place, that is, to be good corporate citizens. This paper describes how internal auditors and other corporate managers can assist corporations to attain corporate social responsibility goals, notably, to advance gender equality.

Keywords: gender equality, gender pay audit, corporate social responsibility
