Abstract

This paper examines whether earnings benchmarks influence firms’ aggressiveness toward consumer digital privacy. I find that firms narrowly beating the prior year’s earnings engage in significantly higher third-party online tracking within their domains, even after controlling for conventional accrual-based and real activity-based earnings management (EM) channels. Consumer data collection intensifies when traditional EM strategies are constrained. Two mechanisms explain these findings: increased tracking boosts site visits via personalized ads and enhances discretionary spending effectiveness. However, using the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) materiality indicator to assess the overall costs of consumer privacy, I find that the main effect weakens when consumer privacy poses a material sustainability risk or when firms prioritize data governance. Overall, this research highlights firms’ responses to earnings benchmarks in the increasingly important yet often hidden digital space, affecting almost everyone via the Internet.

Keywords: Digital Privacy, Earnings Benchmarks, Technology
