Abstract

This study examines the impact of Top Management Team (TMT) faultlines on corporate ESG performance under economic policy uncertainty, using data from China's A-share listed manufacturing firms (2013-2018). Results show that stronger TMT faultlines positively influence ESG performance, but this effect weakens under high economic policy uncertainty. Further analysis reveals an inverted U-shaped relationship in stateowned enterprises, low-marketization regions, and firms with low media attention, where ESG performance rises initially but declines as faultline intensity grows. These findings highlight the dual impact of TMT faultlines and their integration into ESG performance frameworks.

Keywords: Top Management Team Faultlines, Economic Policy Uncertainty, Corporate ESG Performance, Corporate Governance
