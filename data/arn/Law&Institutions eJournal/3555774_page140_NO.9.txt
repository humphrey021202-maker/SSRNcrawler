Abstract

We examine whether US shareholder-initiated class action lawsuits can discipline non-US firms. Using an international sample of firms over the period 1994-2019, we find that a US class-action lawsuit against a non-US firm cross-listed in the US negatively affects the value of its non-US-listed industry peers. We uncover two economic mechanisms underlying this effect: information sharing and policy coordination between the US and the non-US firm’s home country. Moreover, non-US peer firms subsequently improve their governance practices and financial policies to restore shareholder value. Our findings suggest that private enforcement in the US has a worldwide influence.
