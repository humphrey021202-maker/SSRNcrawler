Abstract

Insiders often disclose non-GAAP earnings metrics in addition to GAAP earnings and can trade using their non-GAAP earnings information advantage for personal benefit. We find that, compared to insiders at GAAP firms, insiders at non-GAAP firms exploit their non-GAAP earnings information advantage to sell their shares, with strong evidence for insiders at non-GAAP firms that are monitored less intensively and disclose non-GAAP earnings more aggressively. Moreover, we find greater insider selling following increased SEC non-GAAP disclosure guidance, but lower insider selling profitability. Our results could be used to better identify opportunistic non-GAAP earnings disclosure.

Keywords: non-GAAP, earnings, insider trading, private information
