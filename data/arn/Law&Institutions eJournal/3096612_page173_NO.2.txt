Abstract

The last three decades has seen the term “corporate governance” emerged clearly as an independent field of study. Its scope has also witnessed great expansion such that it is now an amalgam of different disciplines, including accounting, economics, ethics, finance, law, management, organizational behavior, and politics, among others, with no universally accepted definition. As a corollary, there exist a large number of definitions of corporate. Despite the existence of heterogeneous definitions, however, researchers frequently classify the existing corporate governance definitions as either “narrow” or “broad.” As a prelude, the narrow broad dichotomization is based on the extent to which a corporate governance regime essentially focuses on satisfying the parochial interests’ of shareholders or meeting the broader interests of diverse societal stakeholder groups.

Keywords: Corporate Governance, Shareholders, Stakeholders

JEL Classification: G40
