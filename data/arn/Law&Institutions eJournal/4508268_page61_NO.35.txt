Abstract

We examine how firms’ AI-accounting capability influences the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting (ICFR). Drawing on dynamic capability theory, we conceptualize AI-accounting capability as an adaptive resource that enhances firms’ ability to respond to environmental changes and emerging risks in financial reporting. Using a novel dataset of job postings, we measure AI-accounting capability through firms’ demand for combined AI and accounting skills. Our findings reveal that firms with greater AI-accounting capability report fewer material weaknesses in their internal controls. This effect is particularly pronounced for IT-related control weaknesses but is less effective for weaknesses stemming from human conduct. Additionally, drawing on resource orchestration theory, we find this relationship is affected by managerial ability, highlighting the crucial role of management in effectively deploying AI resources. Our study contributes to understanding how AI transforms financial reporting processes, providing valuable insights for firms considering AI investments to enhance their financial reporting quality and regulatory compliance.




Keywords: artificial intelligence, accounting, internal control over financial reporting, dynamic capability view, resource orchestration theory, financial reporting
