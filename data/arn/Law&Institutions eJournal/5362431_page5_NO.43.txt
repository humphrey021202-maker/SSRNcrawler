Abstract

We investigate the impact of the controversial 2022 amendment to Rule 10b5-1, which imposed a cooling-off period and restricted overlapping and single trade plans on prearranged insider transactions. The amendment led insiders to (i) execute stock sales under 10b5-1 plans with longer cooling-off periods; (ii) curtail opportunistic sales under 10b5-1 plans prior to stock price drops or earnings misses; (iii) limit the backdating of stock gifts; and (iv) decrease the granting of options around material information events. .Further evidence suggests a reduction in opportunistic 10b5-1 trades rather than a migration toward non-10b5-1 sales. However, we find that firms more affected by the rule amendment experience lower price efficiency after the amendment, implying a potential cost of restricting the flow of information through insider trading. In addition, terminations of 10b5-1 plans are associated with positive subsequent stock returns, suggesting that insiders avoid selling when they expect favorable news. Overall, our findings indicate that while the amendment substantially curtailed the opportunistic use of 10b5-1 plans, it increased the costs of 10b5-1 plans and lowered stock price efficiency.

Keywords: insider trading, 10b5-1
