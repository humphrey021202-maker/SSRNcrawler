Abstract

We employ a novel measure of "Mind Politics" sentiment--ideologically affirmative terms--to analyze the textual content of firm-specific news for over 4,000 publicly listed Chinese firms from 2014-2020. We find that private enterprises, unlike state-owned firms, actively use political sentiment in media narratives to signal their political connections. Political sentiment is positively associated with increased government subsidies, reduced financing constraints, and diminished litigation risk. Our measure outperforms traditional proxies for political connections, including executive backgrounds, in predicting such institutional support. Our findings highlight political sentiment as a powerful, yet underexplored mechanism for navigating modern China's corporate political economy.
