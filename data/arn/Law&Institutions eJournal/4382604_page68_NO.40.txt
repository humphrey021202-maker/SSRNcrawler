Abstract

I investigate whether managers learn about who is buying and selling their firm’s stocks before public disclosure. To do so, I examine insider trading prior to the disclosure of blockholder formations on Schedule 13Ds and 13Gs. Schedule 13Ds and 13Gs are required when activist or passive investors have acquired more than 5% of a firm’s shares, respectively. These disclosures result in a significant price jump of 6.1% for Schedule 13Ds or 1.7% for 13Gs. My analysis documents abnormally high insider net purchases in the days leading up to the disclosures, peaking precisely on the day that blockholders cross the 5% threshold. Importantly, price and volume signals cannot fully account for the observed insider behavior. Cross-sectional analyses reveal that pre-disclosure insider net purchases are significantly higher when investors report pre-filing communication with the management team, when investors and target firms are geographically proximate, or when companies have actively invested in investor relations. This evidence suggests that investor relation efforts help managers learn about blockholders’ trades. Collectively, my results reveal that managers learn about their firms’ ownership changes by interpreting market signals and communicating with investors, and they subsequently trade on this information before public disclosure.

Keywords: insider trading, private information, Schedule 13D, activist investors, ownership disclosures, investor relations
