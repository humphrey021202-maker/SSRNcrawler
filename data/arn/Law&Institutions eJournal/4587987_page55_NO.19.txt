Abstract

This paper critically reviews the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Comment Letter literature with a focus on value. The economic significance of SEC reviews and Comment Letters may be relevant to public policy determinations and the evaluation of related research. La Porta et al. (2006) casts doubt on the value of public regulation enforcement. Review limitations and the U.S. financial reporting institutional setting may limit Comment Letter impact. A comprehensive assessment of effects and settings is required. For example, recurring filing reviews may be a deterrent to substandard reporting, but no published research examines it. IPO Comment Letters offer a powerful setting but have received little research attention. Comment Letters present many empirical challenges, including heterogeneity in the significance of letters and comments. Significant outcomes resulting from 10-K/10-Q Comment Letters are infrequent, and market impact evidence is limited. The dramatic decline in 10-K/10-Q Comment Letter cases (2010 – 2021) warrants examination. Future research suggestions include documenting and valuing a deterrent effect, a market analysis of Comment Letter-induced restatements, an exploration of a link between filing reviews and SEC enforcement actions, and an analysis of the revenue recognition comments in IPO Comment Letters.
