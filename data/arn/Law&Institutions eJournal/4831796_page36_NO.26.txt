Abstract

We examine how security analysts influence competitive product market interactions among US public firms. Using product announcement data, we show that firms tend to launch new products in response to rivals’ product launches, especially when sharing analyst coverage. These results are not due to common economic shocks. Comparing recommendation revisions by analysts covering both rival and focal firms versus those covering only rivals, we find that only favorable revisions from common analysts following rivals’ product announcements are influential for new product announcements. We find evidence supporting both an information spillovers channel and a peer pressure channel, in which common analysts play a role. Our findings reveal a key feedback effect from financial markets to firms’ strategic decision-making.

Keywords: Feedback Effect, Product Announcements, Common Analysts, Competition
