Abstract

Replacing founder-CEOs is one of the most important decisions venture capital investors face. This paper shows that the very contracts that enable founders to attract funding provide them with incentives to manipulate the performance metrics used in replacement decisions. Although contracts with generous founder exit packages eliminate manipulation incentives, which ensures efficient replacements and maximizes total surplus, they generate insufficient pledgeable income for financially constrained founders to secure capital. The model generates several empirical predictions. First, the rise of cloud computing, which sharply lowers startup capital requirements, leads to larger founder exit packages, less performance manipulation, and more frequent founder replacements. Second, in technologically complex sectors such as AI and biotech, where performance metrics are inherently opaque, optimal exit packages are smaller, manipulation is more severe, and founder turnover is lower. These predictions imply that variation in founder turnover rates, manipulation, and exit packages across industries and over time can reflect differences in capital requirements and technological complexity rather than differences in governance quality.
