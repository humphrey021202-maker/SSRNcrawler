Abstract

The study provides a comprehensive overview of contemporary sustainability accounting research, comprising 1,283 academic articles published in 54 journals (2014-2020). Sustainability disclosure is the most frequently researched topic and a substantial proportion of publications analyse a national setting, examine a European context, investigate listed firms, adopt the quantitative methodology and an empirical archival research method, apply social and political theories, or focus broadly on sustainability. Based on this analysis, we develop a conceptual framework of sustainability accounting influences. We discuss prevalent themes, empirical findings and apparent inconsistencies, reflecting on recent trends and the state of sustainability accounting knowledge, developing an agenda for future research.

Keywords: Sustainability accounting, Corporate social responsibility, Social and environmental, Sustainable development, Management system, Stakeholder engagement, Disclosure, Assurance
