Abstract

We investigate whether banks conduct environmental, social, and governance (ESG) washing practices in their lending decisions and how the market reacts to these practices. That is, banks with worse ESG sentiments intentionally lend to firms with higher ESG sentiments to improve their ESG reputations. Worse ESG banks offer significantly lower loan spreads, longer loan maturities, fewer general covenants, and fewer collaterals to firms with higher ESG sentiments. More importantly, the stock market generally reacts favorably to banks that lend these deals, which could explain why banks engage in the ESG washing practices. We also find that the ESG washing effects are significantly stronger for borrowers from high polluting industries and during the post-Kyoto Protocol period. These results support the idea that the banks with worse ESG sentiments tend to divert away the market’s attention to their ESG washing lending, thus improving their ESG reputations.

Keywords: ESG, syndicated loan, market reactions, Kyoto Protocol, bank sustainability performance

JEL Classification: G21, G32, M14, Q51, Q52
