Abstract

This paper explores strategies for generating and evaluating novel research ideas. Researchers can identify promising ideas by systematically exposing themselves to new, practitioner-relevant information and by contrasting emerging facts with existing theories. Additionally, by identifying the necessary conditions that are required for an idea to become a viable research project, researchers can quickly discard low-prospect ideas, freeing up mental space and time to evaluate new research opportunities.

Keywords: Research Methods, Idea Generation, Academic Research, Research Process, Research Strategies, Research Productivity
