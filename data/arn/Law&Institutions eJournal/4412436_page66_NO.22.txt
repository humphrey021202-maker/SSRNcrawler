Abstract

CFOs report using elevated hurdle rates that average 6.6 percentage points above the cost of capital. We show that hurdle rate buffers act as a commitment device and convey a bargaining advantage over counterparties during project development and M&A. This benefit can exceed the opportunity cost of forgone projects and acquisitions, preserving firm value. Consistent with our model, bidders’ elevated hurdle rates in M&A deals associate with higher surplus capture ex post; in CFO survey data, hurdle rate buffers negatively relate to ex ante bargaining power, and realized returns cluster just above elevated hurdle rates.

Keywords: hurdle rates, cost of capital, buffers, capital budgeting, bargaining, project development, project selection, corporate investment, M&A

JEL Classification: G30, G31, G32, G34
