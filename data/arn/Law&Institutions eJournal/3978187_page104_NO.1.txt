Abstract

Exploiting the introduction of EDGAR, I study how improved access to public firm disclosures affects private firm financing through IPOs. The results show IPO firm underpricing decreases systematically as more public peer firms adopt EDGAR. This finding is stronger when IPO investors face more valuation uncertainty, when peer firms’ information quality is high, when alternative information sources are scarce, and when peer disclosures contain more industry-wide information. Increased equity research coverage of public peers also contributes to this finding.  Together, the results suggest better dissemination of public firm disclosures can reduce frictions for private firms seeking to procure equity capital.

Keywords: disclosure processing costs, externalities, capital formation

JEL Classification: G14, G12, G38
