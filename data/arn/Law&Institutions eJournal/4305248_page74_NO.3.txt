Abstract

We examine the nature and consequences of corporate reputation-building actions following major violations of environmental and social (labor and consumer safety) laws. We construct a novel dataset of potential reputation-building actions taken by firms, based on hand-classification of 21,932 press releases surrounding 411 serious violations (e.g., an oil spill or a major labor lawsuit verdict). We find that while firms do take more reputation-building actions after such violations, these actions typically do not benefit the stakeholders affected by the underlying violation. Instead, firms appear to target customers with reputation-building actions irrespective of the type of violation, and target employees and shareholders after environmental (but not social) violations. Regarding consequences, increased environmental or social actions correlate with lower future rates of recidivism when topically aligned with the underlying incident (e.g., environmental actions after a major environmental violation). Finally, the stock market responds positively to reputation-building actions targeted at shareholders and customers, but not to those aimed at other stakeholder groups, suggesting investor motivations are, on average, primarily financial rather than broadly prosocial. These findings highlight a divergence between remedial needs and actual corporate responses, emphasizing reputational management towards financially relevant stakeholders.

Keywords: reputation repair, corporate social responsibility, ESG, labor violation, environmental violation
