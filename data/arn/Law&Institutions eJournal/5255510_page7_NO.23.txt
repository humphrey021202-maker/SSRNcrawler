Abstract

Crowdfunding has surfaced as a pivotal financing method, offering Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) unique avenues to obtain funding, stimulate innovation, and connect with stakeholders. This investigation examines the influence of crowdfunding on the innovation of Small and Mediam-Sized Entreprise (SMSE), emphasizing its role in overcoming financial obstacles, confirming market demand, and fostering collaborative networks. The study utilized a mixed-methods approach, analyzing data from 200 crowdfunding campaigns and conducting qualitative interviews with 30 small and medium-sized enterprise owners and 10 experts. The results indicate that increased funding levels and proactive involvement from backers significantly improve innovation results, such as product introductions, patent registrations, and revenue expansion. Furthermore, crowdfunding acts as a mechanism for validating market demand and fostering creative exploration, allowing small and medium enterprises to enhance their products and explore innovative concepts. The investigation emphasizes crowdfunding as a pivotal mechanism for promoting innovation and provides actionable insights for SMSE, policymakers, and relevant stakeholders. Future studies should investigate sector-specific dynamics and the enduring impacts of crowdfunding on innovation ecosystems.

Keywords: Crowdfunding, SME Innovation, Market Validation, Stakeholder Engagement, Alternative Finance, Entrepreneurial Ecosystems
