Abstract

Recent sociopsychological literature suggests that tight cultures cultivate conformist attitudes and behaviors. I find evidence that Chinese firms operating in culturally tight regions exhibit high earnings comparability. Instrumental regressions using the local concentration of paddy fields and population density as instruments confirm a positive effect of cultural tightness on earnings comparability. Stability-seeking and risk-aversion are underlying channels through which local cultural tightness affects earnings comparability, whereas innovation mitigates the positive role of cultural tightness in earnings comparability. Comparability in culturally tight environments hinders the incorporation of firm-specific information into stock prices. By leveraging the 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake that generates variation in cultural tightness as an experimental setting, I observe an increase in earnings comparability for affected firms relative to others. Finally, earnings comparability relates positively to earnings smoothness activities. This study reveals that earnings comparability in culturally tight settings is likely superficial because of conformity bias.

Keywords: cultural tightness, conformity, earnings comparability, superficial comparability
