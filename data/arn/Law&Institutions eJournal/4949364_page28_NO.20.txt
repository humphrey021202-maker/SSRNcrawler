Abstract

We examine the impact of enhanced employee orientation, proxied by the staggered adoption of state-level constituency statutes between 1983 and 2018, on labor investment efficiency. Using a difference-in-differences analysis, we find that firms experience a significant decline in labor investment efficiency, measured as deviations from optimal net hiring, following the adoption of these statutes. The effect is more pronounced in labor-intensive firms, those with greater employee bargaining power, weaker corporate governance, and firms headquartered in states with low social capital. Our findings suggest that constituency statutes, while intended to protect stakeholder interests, particularly employees, inadvertently foster manager-employee alliances. These alliances allow self-interested managers to pursue private incentives by refraining from optimal hiring, thereby compromising shareholder value. The results highlight that employee orientation, under weak monitoring conditions, can exacerbate agency problems and distort labor resource allocation.

Keywords: stakeholder orientation, agency problem, manager-employee alliance, constituency statutes
