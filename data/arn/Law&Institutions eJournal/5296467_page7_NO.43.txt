Abstract

This study examines how stronger trade secrets protection, via state-level adoption of the Inevitable Disclosure Doctrine (IDD), influences firms' innovation and communication strategies. We argue that IDD enhances appropriability and spurs innovation, but it also increases the novelty and complexity of firm outputs. This change raises information processing costs for external stakeholders. Using a stacked difference-indifferences design, we find that IDD adoption significantly boosts innovation. In response to the resulting complexity, firms adapt their communication: product descriptions become more similar across competitors, suggesting strategic conformity to ease customer evaluation, and financial statement comparability modestly improves, facilitating investor analysis. These findings reveal how firms balance the benefits of innovation with stakeholders' information burdens, illustrating a trade-off between differentiation and conformity shaped by legal institutions.

Keywords: Inevitable Disclosure Doctrine, innovation, information processing costs, trade secrets
