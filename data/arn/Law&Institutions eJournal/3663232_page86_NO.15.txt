Abstract

In this paper, we examine whether and how FAS 123R, an exogenous negative shock to firms’ incentive to grant options to employees, influences their brand capital. We find that firms being affected more by FAS 123R suffer a lower success ratio of new brands afterward, which can be attributed to reduced efforts from employees. Further analyses document significant drops in both rank-and-file employees’ effort and executives’ effort among affected firms after the enactment. In addition, the negative effect of FAS 123 on brand success is more pronounced for firms whose performance is more sensitive to employee effort and cannot be explained by changes in corporate governance or financial constraints. Moreover, we find that firms more affected by FAS 123R are associated with lower product quality, customer satisfaction, sales growth, and profit growth after the enactment, confirming the effect of unmotivated employees.

Keywords: FAS 123R; option compensation; brand name; trademarks; employee effort; rank and file; executives
