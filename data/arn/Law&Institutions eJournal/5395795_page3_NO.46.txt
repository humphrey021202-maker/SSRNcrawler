Abstract

This paper investigates how CFO-CEO co-option --- defined as the appointment of a CFO during the tenure of the incumbent CEO --- affects corporate investment efficiency. Using a comprehensive panel of Chinese A-share listed firms from 2000 to 2022, we find that CFO co-option is significantly associated with higher levels of investment inefficiency. This effect remains robust across alternative model specifications, variable constructions, and multiple strategies addressing endogeneity, including instrumental variable estimation, matching techniques, and dynamic panel models. Further analysis reveals that the adverse impact of co-option is particularly pronounced under high macroeconomic uncertainty, but is attenuated in firms facing tighter financial constraints or operating in more concentrated industries. Mediation tests show that impaired financial reporting quality serves as a key mechanism through which co-option distorts capital allocation. Contrary to expectations, the effect does not vary meaningfully with CFO gender, tenure, or age, suggesting that structural alignment rather than personal characteristics drives the inefficiency. Our findings highlight the governance risks embedded in intra-executive loyalty networks and underscore the critical role of CFO independence in safeguarding investment discipline.

Keywords: Investment Inefficiency；CEO；CFO；Co-option
