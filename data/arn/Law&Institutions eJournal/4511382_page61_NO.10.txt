Abstract

This paper offers an innovative and robust exploration of share buyback execution strategies, unveiling three previously unrecognized anomalies that cast doubts on traditional financial theories. We first introduce the Trading Schedule Anomaly, an atypical timing and sequencing pattern observed during buyback operations. Secondly, we delve into the Benchmark Paradox, which exposes the recurrent use of possibly flawed benchmarks in buyback processes; benchmarks that, while seemingly effortless to surpass, often lead to inflated costs and misdirected incentives. Lastly, we unpack the Psychological Misconception, highlighting how cognitive biases can entrap corporations into accepting excessive costs under the illusion of surpassing a less efficient benchmark.

Employing a thorough combination of empirical investigation and cutting-edge genetic algorithm simulations, we dissect these anomalies. This rigorous methodological mix not only allows us to enrich our understanding of share buybacks but also to challenge long-established norms within the realm of corporate finance.

Considering the critical role share buybacks play in corporate finance strategy, the insights revealed in this paper hold substantial relevance to practitioners and academics alike. The findings not only demystify the complexities of buyback execution strategies but also call for a rethinking of existing financial practices.

By explicating the nature of these paradoxes and their potential implications on shareholder value, this research contributes to a transformative shift in how share buybacks are perceived and handled. Consequently, the paper holds substantial potential to significantly impact corporate finance practices and stimulate novel directions in future academic discourse.
