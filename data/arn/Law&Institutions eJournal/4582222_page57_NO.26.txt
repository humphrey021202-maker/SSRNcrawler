Abstract

This paper investigates the effect of board reforms implemented in 41 countries worldwide on corporate tax avoidance. We use a difference-in-differences method and find that firms avoid more taxes following the reform. Further evidence reveals that the increase in tax avoidance is less pronounced for firms in countries with strong external governance and more pronounced for firms in countries with weak financial reporting regulations. The results are also robust to alternative tax avoidance measures, alternative samples, entropy balancing, placebo tests, and other robustness checks.

Keywords: Board reform, tax avoidance, external governance

JEL Classification: G3, H2, K2
