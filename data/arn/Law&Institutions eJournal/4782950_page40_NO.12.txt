Abstract

Information asymmetry and agency conflicts are likely to be more severe in de-SPACs (private companies merging with an exchange-traded “special purpose acquisition companies or SPACs), than in IPOs. Therefore, according to the IPO literature, de-SPACs benefit more from retaining larger auditors because larger auditors are more effective as external monitors and in reducing misreporting than smaller auditors. Yet, we find that de-SPACs are considerably less likely to retain a larger auditor, i.e., a Big 4 firm, than an IPO. While we do find that larger auditors like the Big 4 charge considerably more than other auditors from their de-SPAC clients (a premium for higher reporting quality), we fail to find evidence that reporting problems are lower in de-SPACs with Big 4 than non-Big 4 auditors. Our findings indicate that the de-SPAC financial reporting problems are neither infrequent nor transitory regardless of auditor quality. Finally, we provide some insights into larger auditor retention by a de-SPAC using de-SPAC deal characteristics and risk attributes. Collectively, these results underscore the diminished monitoring role of larger auditors in de-SPACs when compared to their prominent role in IPOs.

Keywords: de-SPAC, IPO, audit firm quality, financial reporting quality, auditor turnover, underperformance
