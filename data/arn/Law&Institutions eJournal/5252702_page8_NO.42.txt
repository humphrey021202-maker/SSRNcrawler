Abstract

Knowledge Management Systems (KMS) have evolved significantly in the digital age, emerging as essential tools for organizations seeking to harness collective expertise, foster collaboration, and drive effective decision-making. This review paper explores the core concepts of KMS, the technologies underpinning them, and their role in enhancing collaborative processes and strategic outcomes. By examining theoretical frameworks, real-time data trends, and case examples, we highlight best practices and emerging challenges in implementing and optimizing KMS in contemporary organizational settings.
