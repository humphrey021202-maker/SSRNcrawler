Abstract

In the conditions of digital transformation, change of business models and more requirements to the transparency and accuracy of disclosed information, the corporate reporting - financial and nonfinancial - still adheres to the paper format. The introduced requirement for European public companies to use the European Single Electronic Financial Reporting Format (ESEF) aims to increase the analytical qualities of the disclosed information. The main thesis we share is that the introduction of ESEF will allow a wide range of users to use the reports, extracting from them the information they need, and the digitalization of reporting can enable managers to focus on specific risks that determine the value of the business. Arguments regarding the digitalization of non-financial reporting in the context of the lack of a uniform framework and standards for disclosure are also considered. Bulgarian public enterprises from wood based industry - public and non-public, were studied, and the results of the study significantly support our thesis.

Keywords: digital reporting, ESEF, Bulgarian wood based companies
