Abstract

We investigate whether “passive” index-tracking institutional investors (index investors) impact the aggregation of their investee firms’ geographic disclosures. We find that when index investors own more of their stock, U.S. multinationals tend to reduce transparency about foreign operations by aggregating the geographic disclosures in their financial statement footnotes. However, this aggregation is less pronounced for firms facing higher information asymmetry related to corporate tax planning, organizational complexity, and low-quality accounting practices, as well as for firms owned by index investors with greater monitoring resources. Our inferences are robust to tests that address endogeneity concerns by exploiting the Russell index reconstitution as a source of exogenous variation in index investor stockholdings. Overall, our findings suggest that index investors influence investee firms’ disclosure aggregation and that their demand for informational transparency is nuanced.

Keywords: Voluntary disclosure; Geographic disclosures; Disclosure aggregation; Index investors; Institutional ownership; Monitoring
