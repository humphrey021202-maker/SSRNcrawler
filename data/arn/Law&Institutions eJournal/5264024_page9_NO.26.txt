Abstract

To enhance conceptual understanding and operationalisation of boundaries (i.e., what is included and not included in annual report sections) and connectivity (i.e., the attribute enabling a holistic and coherent set of information within and across different annual report sections) of climate-related disclosures in annual reports, we (1) compare boundary and connectivity guidance by contemporary sustainability and financial accounting standard setters; (2) analyse annual reports of 80 large, listed companies, across five climate-sensitive industries and four IFRS jurisdictions (Australia, Canada, the EU and the UK) in 2022 and 2017; and (3) obtain multidisciplinary stakeholder perspectives through 20 semi-structured interviews in Australia and the EU. We propose a conceptual framework of connectivity mechanisms for climate-related disclosures in annual reports based on interpretation of prior literature, comparative analysis of contemporary standards, observed disclosures, and multi-disciplinary stakeholder interviews. We provide a comparative analysis of boundary dimensions of contemporary accounting and sustainability standards relating to climate. This contributes to prior literature on climate-related reporting, and scarce literature on reporting boundaries and connectivity within corporate reporting, especially in the new era of mandatory climate reporting. Empirical analysis on reporting boundaries and connectivity mechanisms provides useful insights for standard setters, auditors, preparers and users of annual reports.
