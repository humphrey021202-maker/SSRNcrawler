Abstract

This study investigates the transformation of external audit practices in Malaysia, a developing country, during and after the Covid-19 pandemic lockdowns, focusing on the shift to remote auditing among Big 4 audit firms. Drawing on 20 in-depth face-to-face interviews with 28 audit professionals, we explore how auditors adapted to unprecedented challenges where remote audits were previously uncommon and clients lagged in adopting accounting technologies. Utilizing the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework, we identify three key findings: (1) Auditors rapidly integrated IT general controls (ITGCs) and digital tools into audit planning and evidence collection, enhancing efficiency despite initial challenges with client system reliability; (2) Flexible work arrangements and hybrid meeting models emerged as lasting organizational adaptations, improving work-life balance while straining team cohesion; and (3) The pandemic catalyzed a significant shift in client technology adoption, with many clients permanently embracing digital platforms, though disparities in technological readiness persisted.
