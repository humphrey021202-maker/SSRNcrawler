Abstract

Most of the applications and uses of digital assets are improved and expanded with well-functioning and well-governed DAOs. The article evaluates the technical and internal governance solutions promulgated by DAO projects. Particular emphasis is placed on the duality of feedback effects between internal DAO governance and external DAO legal designs.
