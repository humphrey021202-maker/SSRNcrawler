Abstract

Sell-side analysts generate revenue through personalized interactions with client funds. We utilize a novel dataset identifying each brokerage's commission-paying fund clients to examine how these client relationships shape analyst research. We first show that brokerages initiate coverage when clients own a stock, suggesting that brokerages respond to client funds' information needs. Regarding forecast properties, we find that client ownership leads to greater optimism and improved accuracy, accompanied by more frequent revisions and increased information acquisition. Three additional analyses support the view that client relationships lead to enhanced forecast quality rather than catering. First, forecast quality increases with client funds' information acquisition. Second, forecast accuracy leads to higher future commissions, while optimism does not. Third, client holdings increase the information content of recommendations. Collectively, our evidence suggests that client relationships stimulate the production of informative research.

Keywords: analyst incentives, sell-side analysts, earnings forecasts, forecast bias
