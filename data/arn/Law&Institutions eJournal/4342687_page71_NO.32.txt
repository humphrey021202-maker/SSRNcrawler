Abstract

We examine how a fixed capital supply shortage affects firm investment. Using equipment
transaction-level data, we find pandemic-driven production disruptions significantly
altered capital reallocation patterns across firms. A surge in used capital trading activity
softened the investment decline, as firms acquired used capital from distant and dissimilar
counterparts. Younger firms were disproportionately affected even though they rarely
purchase new capital: while in normal times older firms sell their capital to younger firms,
following a supply shortage, older firms compete for used capital, pricing out younger
firms. Our evidence highlights the crucial role of secondary markets and distributive
externalities for corporate investment.

Keywords: Investment, capital reallocation, secondary markets, SMEs, supply chain, COVID-19
