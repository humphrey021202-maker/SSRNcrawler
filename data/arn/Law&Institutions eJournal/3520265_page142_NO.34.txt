Abstract

This article surveys the recent literature on boards of directors and the interplay between director incentives and CEO incentives. The primary focus is on how the incentives and other characteristics of directors, boards and CEOs interact to affect firm performance. The article reviews the recent evidence documenting a causal relationship between board independence and measures of firm performance. It also discusses the major limitations of the current measure of director independence. Finally, the article highlights how board independence provides strong incentives for CEOs to create firm value and examines the recent evidence on what other director characteristics improve board effectiveness.

Keywords: Boards, Directors, CEO Incentives, Independent Directors

JEL Classification: G34
