Abstract

This paper introduces the metaverse concept into accounting research and examines its potential to refine long-standing accounting norms and practices that have remained largely unchanged for centuries. Emerging as a global phenomenon in 2022, the metaverse represents a virtual digital space capable of replicating and augmenting real-world environments. Although its popularity has recently waned, the metaverse offers a valuable lens to address persistent accounting challenges, such as the limitations of traditional valuation models and periodic reporting frameworks. This study highlights how the metaverse could inspire innovative accounting approaches, particularly through its native features of consensus-based trust mechanisms and redefined materiality concepts enabled by microtransactions and programmable currencies. While the metaverse's long-term viability remains uncertain, this paper systematically reviews relevant literature and proposes a 10-year research roadmap to guide future scholarly and practical advancements in accounting.

Keywords: Metaverse Accounting, Digital Assets Valuation, IFRS Adaptation, Virtual Economies, Virtual Reporting Entities
