Abstract

In this study, we explore managerial compensation contracts in Japan, based on financial reporting comparability as a basic peer firms’ setting. Although listed companies in Japan are required to disclose their managerial compensation contracts since 2019, most companies do not report the details of their compensation contracts. In this situation, several firms which disclose their contract state that they decide managerial compensation using peer firms’ compensation as a benchmark. Based on this practice, we examine managerial compensation to investigate whether Japanese firms set peer firms’ compensations for benchmarking. Assuming financial reporting comparability as a peer selection criterion because Japanese firms frequently use the accounting-based indicator in managerial performance evaluations, while, in the US, accounting-based relative performance evaluation is observed empirically, we find that accounting-based relative performance evaluation is not applied, and peer compensation is adopted as a benchmark for managerial compensation contracts in Japan. Our results propose that investors should pay attention to peer firms’ behavior as an indicator of a firm’s governance in Japan. Additionally, our result suggests that, depending on country culture, firms set the managerial compensation contract in practice, and therefore, regulators must pay attention to the culture when they design the regulation about the managerial compensation contract or disclosure.

Keywords: managerial compensation contracts, benchmarking, relative performance evaluation, compensation peer group, financial reporting comparability
