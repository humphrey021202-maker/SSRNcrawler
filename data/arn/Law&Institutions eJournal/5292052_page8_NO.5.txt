Abstract

India's convergence with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) through Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) has entailed selective departures known as "carve-outs" and "carve-ins." This article critically evaluates these divergences between Ind AS and IFRS, with references to US GAAP where pertinent. We examine the motivation behind IFRS convergence in India and define the nature of carveouts/carve-ins. A qualitative comparative analysis is employed, drawing on official standards, regulatory guidance, and financial reports of major Indian companies. We identify and tabulate all current carve-outs, explaining their rationale, accounting treatment differences, and impacts on financial statement analysis. Using real company data across IT, pharmaceutical, energy, telecom, and banking sectors, we demonstrate how specific Ind AS deviations (such as those in revenue recognition, financial instruments, consolidation, etc.) affect profitability, leverage, and valuation ratios. The discussion weighs whether these carve-outs enhance contextual relevance or impair transparency and comparability, offering policy recommendations toward greater harmonization. We conclude by summarizing contributions and suggesting avenues for future research, including the evolving regulatory landscape through 2025.

Keywords: IFRS convergence, Ind AS, carve-outs, harmonization, financial reporting comparability, US GAAP, regulatory adaptation
