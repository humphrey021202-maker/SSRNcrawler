Abstract

In 2020, the SEC issued amendments to Regulation S-K requiring filers to provide discussions related to their human capital (HC) management practices. We investigate how firms respond to this principles-based disclosure mandate during its first two years of implementation. We find that firm disclosure decisions are significantly influenced by their general reporting styles, institutional ownership, product market competition, and HC management performance. Rather than evolving towards "best in class" practices, firms exhibit regression towards the mean on all qualitative characteristics: length, topics, specificity, numerical intensity, readability, and similarity. Although firms with poorer-quality disclosures improve over time, those with better-quality disclosures reduce their quality, converging toward mediocrity. Despite these limitations, HC disclosure characteristics are value relevant, albeit conditionally so—disclosures are only associated with firm valuations for HC-intensive firms. Our findings suggest that principles-based regulation without specific requirements may not naturally lead to high-quality disclosures, although imperfect disclosures still provide valuable information to markets.
