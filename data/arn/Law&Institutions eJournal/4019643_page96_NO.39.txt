Abstract

We study the governance consequences of institutional investors' re-balancing between internal and external monitoring mechanisms. We exploit a regulatory experiment that lifted short-selling restrictions on a random sample of firms (i.e., Pilot firms). Heightened short-selling threats improve external discipline and alleviate the need for direct monitoring in Pilot firms, allowing monitoring-prone institutional investors to reallocate efforts to other portfolio firms (i.e., Non-pilot firms). We document that Non-pilot firms experience increased shareholder engagement and investor-friendly changes in governance when their monitoring institutional owners have more room for reallocating monitoring efforts.

Keywords: institutional ownership, short-selling constrains, corporate governance

JEL Classification: G23, G30, G32
