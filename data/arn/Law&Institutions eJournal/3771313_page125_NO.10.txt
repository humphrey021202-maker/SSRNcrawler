Abstract

Economic theory predicts that personal tax rates affect individual risk-taking through risk-sharing with the government via full loss offsets. I test this theory by examining the effect of shareholder taxes on bank risk-taking. Exploiting variation in loss offsets under the passive activity loss limitations, I find that increases in shareholder tax rates are positively associated with bank risk-taking when shareholders can use full loss offsets but no evidence of a relation for those that cannot. This increase in risk appears to stem from banks increasing their lending to businesses and home mortgage borrowers with higher loan-to-income ratios. Collectively, my results suggest that the interaction of personal tax rates and tax loss offset rules can create lending externalities by altering bank owners’ personal incentives for risk-taking.


Keywords: corporate risk-taking; financial institutions; personal income taxes; state income taxes
