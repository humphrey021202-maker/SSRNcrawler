Is Family Control Relevant for Corporate Cash Holding Policy?

Abstract

This empirical research examines the effect of family control on firms’ cash holding policy. Using a sample of western European firms, we confirm the precautionary motive for holding cash as family-controlled firms’ desire to perpetuate the family legacy for future generations motivates them to accumulate more cash than their nonfamily counterparts. We also show that, given family-controlled firms’ long-term perspective, they focus on cash flow volatility rather than cash flow level. Finally, the relation between financing constraints and cash holdings is not homogeneous: Financially constrained family-controlled firms hold higher levels of cash than financially constrained nonfamily firms. Overall, these results suggest that family firms’ cash holding policy is the result not of a specific financial outcome but rather on the strategic objectives of the firm.

Keywords: Family firms, cash holding, Euro zone, liquidity, cash flow volatility
