Abstract

We examine whether interlocking boards of directors help facilitate the transfer of scientific and technical knowledge between firms. To capture exogenous variation in board interlocks, we use a novel identification strategy based on schedule conflicts between firms’ annual shareholder meeting dates. For a variety of patent-based measures, we find that a board interlock significantly strengthens the impact of a firm’s innovation on other firms’ innovation quantity, quality, value, and relatedness. Consistent with theories of board functioning, these spillover effects are reduced when one or both boards in an interlock have a high proportion of outsiders or busy directors. Spillover effects are strengthened, however, when shared directors are younger or have more relevant innovation experience. We also find that higher-quality and more focused patents from originating firms, as well as higher relevance of such patents to interlocking firms’ past innovation, can enhance interlock-related spillovers. Overall, our findings suggest that board interlocks are an important channel through which scientific and technical knowledge can flow between firms.
