Abstract

Applying an inductive case study approach, we analyze four Pakistani family business portfolios and reveal that rural-based family business portfolios tend to grow internally (organically) and through related diversification. In contrast, urban-based portfolios rather grow externally through acquisitions and partnerships and pursue unrelated diversification. The family’s entrepreneurial legacy and how it is transferred to members of the next generation through grooming and imprinting in rural versus urban contexts emerge as a key underlying mechanism.
