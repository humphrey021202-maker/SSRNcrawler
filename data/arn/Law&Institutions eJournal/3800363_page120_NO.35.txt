Abstract

Managers often have an incentive to manage earnings in ways that make them look favorable relative to peers. This paper examines whether this incentive extends to internal peer groups within bank holding companies (BHC). While most existing literature focuses on external peer comparisons at the consolidated level, I explore how banks respond to internal subsidiary peers. I find evidence consistent with relative performance evaluation (RPE) – subsidiaries use reporting discretion to respond to the earnings of their internal peers. I further identify scenarios where the BHC exerts more (or less) influence over its subsidiaries. Banks engaging in this behavior may trade off short term gains for long term consequences, as they experience higher non-performing loans and chargeoffs in future periods, and require capital infusions from the BHC. The findings of this study highlight the role of internal peer competition on reporting discretion, and reveal some potential long-term costs of such strategies.

Keywords: bank, relative performance evaluation, loan loss provision, subsidiary
