Abstract

 We study voting for corporate policies when voters face a trade-off between maximizing firm value and implementing social objectives (like minimizing pollution). Contrary to the view that it is impossible to maximize in more than one dimension (Jensen, 2001), we show the collective preferences of voters are well defined when they care about one social objective in addition to firm value.  But this is not generally true when there is more than one social dimension. Consequently, governance becomes highly sensitive to finer details of the process making it difficult for investors to anticipate policy outcomes.  There are exceptions: certain configurations of blockholders make it possible to achieve stable policies even with more than two objectives. Our framework provides novel results about firm objective functions and introduces tools from social choice theory that may assist scholars studying other aspects of governance.

Keywords: Corporate governance, ESG, Shareholder Voting, Social Choice Theory, Socially Responsible Investing, Sustainability, Blockholders, Proxy Voting
