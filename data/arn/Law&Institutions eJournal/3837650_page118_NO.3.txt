Abstract

This paper examines whether issuing management guidance motivates a firm to raise its performance. We hypothesize that managers anticipate failing to attain a forecast reflects poorly on them so issuing a forecast ex-post motivates greater effort. Thus, managers choose to issue guidance ex ante to commit themselves to exert this heightened effort. Consistent with this commitment, management hone their firm’s production function to raise performance. We find evidence supporting this hypothesis: management issue guidance and raise performance at firms when (i) productivity is malleable, (ii) operational uncertainty is present, (iii) performance is credibly measured, and (iv) capital markets strongly reward increased performance. Further, we find that firms alter their operating activities, rather than manage their accruals, to increase performance. The enhancement in firm performance from using managerial guidance as a commitment device is greatest for firms issuing moderately aggressive forecasts and is accomplished by reductions in operating leverage. Inconsistent with concerns that forecasting causes myopia, performance increases persist for several years.

Keywords: management earnings forecast, guidance, commitment, performance
