Abstract

Despite the SEC’s goal of a level investor playing field, research shows that investors benefit from managers’ private disclosures. However, the unobservability of private meetings obscures how much privately disclosed information is nonpublic and how the informativeness of private disclosures varies by communication method, verbal versus nonverbal, and information type, quantitative versus qualitative. To examine these questions, we ask over 300 investors about their interactions with managers in private meetings. These investors report that more than one-quarter of private disclosures are nonpublic, managers’ nonverbal communication (e.g., vocal cues and body language) is relatively informative, and qualitative information is more informative than quantitative information. Thus, bypassing the SEC’s regulatory focus on limiting nonpublic, quantitative information communicated verbally, investors benefit from nonpublic, qualitative information and nonverbal communication. Overall, our study illuminates how investors benefit from private disclosures, despite regulatory restrictions. We also examine how investor horizon, education, and experience affect investors’ responses.

Keywords: private disclosures, professional investors, Regulation Fair Disclosure, nonverbal communication, private meetings
