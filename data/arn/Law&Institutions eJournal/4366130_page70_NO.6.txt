Abstract

Debt contracting creates demand for information from lenders to facilitate two distinct but related activities. Lenders gather information prior to debt contract initiation for screening the borrower. Lenders also collect information once the contract is in force to assess changes in borrower default risk and compliance with information-contingent contract terms – monitoring. I examine what features of information are useful for screening and monitoring, including whether the information is hard or soft; whether it is predictive or reflective; and whether the information includes just recurring components or whether it also admits non-recurring information. I continue by considering how publicly reporting financial information is potentially useful to the lender for screening and monitoring, and conclude by discussing potential avenues for future research.

Keywords: debt contracting, information quality, financial reporting

JEL Classification: G32, M41
