Abstract

In the digital age, managerial decision-making in cost management has become increasingly complex because it is influenced by the dynamics of organizational behavior and technological transformation. Organizations are required to adapt to rapid changes and optimize cost management strategies to maintain competitiveness. This study aims to examine how organizational behavior influences managerial decision-making in cost management in the digital era. This research uses a qualitative method with a literature study approach (library research), which examines various theories and findings of previous research related to managerial decision-making, organizational behavior, and digital innovation in cost management. The results show that behavioral factors, such as leadership style, organizational culture, and resistance to change, play an important role in determining the effectiveness of cost management strategies. In addition, the use of big data analytics, artificial intelligence, and automation systems contributes to improving the accuracy and efficiency of managerial decision-making. However, while digitalization provides significant benefits, challenges such as lack of technological literacy, cognitive bias, and conflicts of interest within organizations remain obstacles in the implementation of digital-based cost management strategies. This research provides insights for academics and practitioners on the importance of understanding the interaction between organizational behavior and technology in managerial decision-making. It is hoped that the results of this research can be a reference for organizational leaders in designing cost management policies that are more adaptive, data-based, and in accordance with the dynamics of organizational behavior in the digital era.

Keywords: Cost Management, Managerial Decision Making, Organizational Behavior, Digital Era, Technological Innovation
