Abstract

This study provides an analysis of ESG reporting practices among DAX 40 companies from 2019 to 2023. It examines trends in the scope and complexity of annual and sustainability reports, and their correlations with ESG ratings from Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) and Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). The findings confirm an increase in report lengths, driven by regulatory demands and stakeholder expectations, with annual reports growing from 253 in 2019 to 315 in 2023. Sustainability reports also expanded, albeit at a slower rate. A trend towards integrated reporting was observed, as some companies incorporated sustainability disclosures into their annual reports, leading to shorter standalone sustainability reports. Despite these changes, the analysis found no significant correlation between the length of business or sustainability reports and the corresponding ESG ratings. Although companies with shorter or no sustainability reports tended to have higher MSCI ratings, and CDP ratings favored shorter sustainability reports, these trends were not statistically significant, suggesting that report length alone is not a strong determinant of ESG ratings. The correlation between MSCI and CDP ratings remains significant but is relatively weak, reflecting the diverging evaluation criteria of different rating agencies. The readability of sustainability reports indicates that despite the increasing amount of information, there was no significant change in content complexity, with average readability index (LIX) scores remaining stable around 58-59 from 2019 to 2023. These findings emphasize the importance of focusing on the quality of disclosures rather than the quantity. The study provides practical recommendations for DAX 40 companies, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and international companies on how to optimize their sustainability reporting and use best practices. Maintaining readability, while ensuring comprehensive yet concise reporting, is highlighted as a key strategy for improving ESG performance across different sectors. This information can be beneficial for companies, especially for finance departments and CFOs, to further improve their reporting practices and to develop and implement best practice approaches.
