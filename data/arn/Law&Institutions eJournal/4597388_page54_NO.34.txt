Abstract

How does competition for talent affect firm growth? Using establishment-level occupational employment microdata and job postings, we measure local occupational market tightness and a firm's corresponding talent retention pressure (TRP) from other firms' job postings in its talent's labor markets. TRP predicts job-to-job outflows of a firm's talent and captures firms' talent-related concerns. We find that higher TRP significantly reduces firms' capital investment, increases talent turnover, and lowers productivity. A shift-share instrumental variable approach reinforces these results. Notably, TRP dampens the growth of laggard firms but not superstars, leading to limited impact on aggregate U.S. investment but increased industry concentration.

Keywords: talent market competition, talent retention, corporate investment, superstar firms, investment-Q gap, industry concentration

JEL Classification: G3, J6
