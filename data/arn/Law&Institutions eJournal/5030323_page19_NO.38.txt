Abstract

We study the impact of blockchain technology on corporate financial reporting quality based on the staggered implementation of blockchain-based e-invoice systems by provincial and municipal governments in China since 2018. Using a difference-indifferences approach with a sample of listed firms in China from 2016 to 2022, we find that the accrual quality and earnings informativeness improve postadoption. This treatment effect is more pronounced for firms with more complex operations and those located in technologically advanced and market-oriented environments, but is similar across firms with varying earnings management incentives. Blockchain adoption is associated with fewer error-related accounting restatements, but not with non-error-related restatements or corporate tax avoidance. Furthermore, blockchain adoption is associated with increased stock liquidity, improved analyst forecast consensus, and lower cost of equity. Overall, our results suggest that the blockchain adoption improves corporate financial reporting quality by enhancing accounting function efficiency rather than deterring potential manipulations.
