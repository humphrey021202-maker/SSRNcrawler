Abstract

This paper provides evidence that firms underperform when their CEOs approach a new decade in life. Research in psychology suggests that individuals frequently enter a temporary period of crisis in 9-ending ages, which is characterized by introspection and self-assessment. I hypothesize that this comes with a diversion from professional responsibilities as CEOs. Consistent with this reasoning, I show that during 9-ending ages of CEO life, firms have decreased operating performance, firm value and long-term investments. This study contributes to the literature on accounting, corporate governance, and CEO characteristics by demonstrating how predictable psychological shifts during CEOs' 9-ending ages influence performance and resource allocation decisions, particularly in Capex and R&D spending, and by highlighting their broader implications for professional decision-making and governance.


Keywords: Firm performance, CEO behavior, CEO age, temporal landmarks, 9-ending age
