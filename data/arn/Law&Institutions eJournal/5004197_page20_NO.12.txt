Abstract

We correct several empirical flaws in the influential Heath, Macciocchi, Michaely, and Ringgenberg (2022) paper. Corrected findings fail to support the claim that index funds do not monitor companies or that their growth harms firm performance and managerial incentives. Moreover, index inclusion and the resulting index ownership shifts do not affect a stock’s level of active fund ownership. Instead, index funds displace ownership by institutions with fewer assets and institutions where the stock represents a smaller share of their assets. The findings suggest that index investing’s impact on corporate governance is more nuanced and less concerning than previous research suggests.

Keywords: Corporate Governance, Index Investing, Monitoring, Voting
