Abstract

Concurrent with the rise of global expectations calling for more corporate social responsibility (CSR), our paper seeks to understand an important driver of CSR performance – board tenure. By combining insights from institutional, agency and stewardship theories, we investigate the role of ingrained governance structures (tenured boards) on CSR performance of firms in Latin America. We explore how this relationship can be influenced by relevant institutional factors, which can hinder or foster the advancement of CSR inside firms in the Latin American context. To best test our hypotheses, we build a unique dataset of measures from firms throughout Latin America that have operations in at least one other country. We utilize different statistical techniques to test our hypotheses. Our primary method is a time series generalized least squares regression with corrections for both panel-specific autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity. Robust analyses of 1,143 firm-level observations across 19 countries from 2010-2019 offer support for our assertions. We find that CSR performance of Latin American firms decreases in the presence of longer tenured boards. Both the country openness and country CSR performance mitigate the negative effect of tenured boards on firm CSR performance.

Keywords: Corporate social responsibility, CSR performance, board tenure, emerging markets, institutional theory.
