Abstract

As the demand for corporate social responsibility (CSR) grows, CEOs play a pivotal role in shaping environmental practices within companies. This study investigates the influence of CEOs’ nature-loving preferences on corporate environmental strategies. Drawing from social ecology research, I measure CEOs' nature-loving preferences based on their childhood interactions with greenspace. This measure is validated through CEOs’ positive discussions of nature during earnings conference calls. Findings show that CEOs with stronger nature-loving preferences significantly increase their firms' involvement in Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects. Rigorous tests address endogenous matching, omitted variable problems, and alternative explanations such as political, monetary, or supply chain incentives. The study also explores implications for shareholders and society, including market reactions and carbon emission reductions. This research demonstrates how CEOs' personal environmental inclinations drive CSR strategies, offering new insights into the determinants of CSR by integrating individual CEO traits into corporate policy.

Keywords: global warming, CEOs, personality traits, nature preference
