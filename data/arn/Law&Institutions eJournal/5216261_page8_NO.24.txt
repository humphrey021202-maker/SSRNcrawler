Abstract

Companies are now reliant on Environmental Social Governance (ESG) reporting which serves as vital assessment material for stakeholders to evaluate non-financial company performance. Greenwashing which involves misleading stakeholders about environmental practices has made ESG disclosures lose their credibility because it has become more prevalent. The article investigates auditor involvement to secure sustainable ESG report integrity through their ethical duties. This discussion explores two major issues with present audits and absent ESG structure standards and shows the necessity of new governance rules. The author supports the requirement for ESG assurance together with standardized ESG auditing procedures and multidisciplinary audit groups to prevent greenwashing and enhance disclosure and rebuild trust between stakeholders.
