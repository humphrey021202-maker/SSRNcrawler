Abstract

Credit access is central to homeownership, yet racial disparities in mortgage lending persist. While lenders increasingly adopt diversity policies, their impact on mortgage lending disparities remains unclear. Using difference-in-differences and event-study designs, we find that diversity policies widen approval disparities, reducing origination rates for minority borrowers. Ex-post loan performance suggests the widened disparities cannot be fully explained by application risks. Mechanism analysis indicates that a stigma effect in approval decisions, triggered by an increase in risky minority applications, likely plays a role. Consistent with stigma, we find greater increases in disparities in market segments with larger documented racial disparities.
