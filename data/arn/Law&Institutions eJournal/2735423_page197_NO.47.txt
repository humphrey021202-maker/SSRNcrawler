Abstract

In this paper, we suggest a special recognition of investments in associates that are able to block essential decisions, such as restructurings. This proposition takes the property rights structure within the associated company that is crucially based on country specific majority requirements into account. Moreover, our approach focuses on a two-line-consolidation that ensures the possibility of signaling voting power and the value stability of investments in associated companies.

Keywords: investments in associates, majority requirements, options for action, Shapley value
