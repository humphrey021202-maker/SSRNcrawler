Abstract

We study whether external assessments by information intermediaries shape CEO dismissal decisions. Specifically, we examine how boards react to the stigmatizing label of new sell recommendations or credit rating downgrades. We find consistent evidence that boards more likely dismiss female and non-white male CEOs, compared to white male CEOs, in response to new sell recommendations or credit rating downgrades, consistent with the stigmatizing label triggering leader prototype bias. We also find a higher likelihood of female CEO dismissal in the presence of two or more female directors, consistent with a "boomerang" effect where more powerful females evaluate female CEOs more harshly than male CEOs when firm performance is poor. In addition to demonstrating sources of variation in boards' CEO dismissal decisions, our findings are consistent with behavioral biases leading to different treatment for CEOs based on occupational minority status.

Keywords: CEO Dismissal, Analysts' Recommendations, Credit Rating Downgrades, Occupational Minority, Female, Non-white Male
