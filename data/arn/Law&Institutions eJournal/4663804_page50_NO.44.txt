Abstract

We survey public company executives and directors to develop a comprehensive understanding of what audit clients want from their auditor in today’s regulated environment. We provide three important takeaways. First, we find that executives and directors view various elements of auditors’ service quality (e.g., timeliness of communication and accessibility) as at least as important as elements of traditional audit quality (e.g., technical expertise). Second, we find no evidence that stakeholders’ preference for service quality in any way replaces their expectation for traditional audit quality. Third, we find that many respondents report being unable to very accurately assess audit quality ex-post, but we find no clear determinants of participants’ self-reported ability to assess quality. Our results highlight the challenges facing auditors as they attempt to simultaneously appease executives and directors, protect shareholders, and comply with regulations, all while offering a product that is inherently challenging for others to assess with existing data and disclosures. Our findings motivate multiple areas of future research and can inform future regulatory efforts.

Keywords: audit demand, audit quality, service quality, technical expertise, flexibility, partner autonomy, credence goods
