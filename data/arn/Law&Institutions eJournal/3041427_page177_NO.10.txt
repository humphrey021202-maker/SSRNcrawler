Abstract

We provide fresh evidence regarding the relation between compensation consultants and CEO pay. First, firms that employ consultants have higher-paid CEOs—this result is robust to firm fixed-effects and matching on economic and governance variables. Second, while this relation is partly due to consultant conflicts of interest, it is largely explained by the impact consultants have on the composition and complexity of CEO pay plans; notably, this impact fully mediates the consultant-CEO pay relation. Third, firms with higher-paid CEOs and more complex pay plans are more likely to hire a consultant. Lastly, say-on-pay voting patterns suggest shareholders view positively the advice consultants provide but only when consultants do not provide other services. We also find suggestive evidence of boards “layering” new equity incentive plans over existing ones, thereby increasing the impact of composition and complexity on CEO pay beyond the premium the CEO would demand for bearing additional compensation risk.

Keywords: Consultants, Benchmarking, Incentive Pay, Governance, Executive Compensation

) from .516 in Table 2 to .373 in Table B1, and similarly decreased the R-squares in column (2) from .535 in Table 2 to .383 in Table B1. For the regressions with firm-fixed effects (column (3)
Since logarithmic transformations require positive values for CEO Pay, the figure excludes 14 firm-years from 6 firms paying their CEOs $0/year. While 99.7% of the Ln(CEO Pay) data are between 2.0 and 12.0 (roughly corresponding to pay levels between $8,000 and $150 million, where CEO Pay is measured in $000s), 41 firm-years (0.3% of the sample of 14,369 firm years, including zeros) have Ln(CEO Pay) less than 2.0. In addition to the 14 firm-years from 6 firms paying their CEOs $0/year excluded from the histogram, the data with Ln(CEO Pay) less than 2.0 include 20 firm-years for 9 CEOs earning a symbolic $1/year in compensation, one firm-year for a CEO earning $10/year, and 6 firm years for 3 CEOs earning between $10 and $8000 per year
Figure B1 shows the histogram for Ln(CEO Pay) for the 14,355 firm-year observations in columns (2) and (3) of Table B1
Our robustness tests demonstrated that our results were highly sensitive to the inclusion of firm-year observations for the CEOs earning less than $1/month (i.e., less than $12/year); our results were not sensitive to using higher thresholds (such as $1,000/year or $10,000/year)
