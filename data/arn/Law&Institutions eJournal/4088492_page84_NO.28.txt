Abstract

Nigerian downstream Oil and Gas industry. The study used secondary data, sourced from audited financial reports of selected quoted companies in the Oil and Gas industry, Nigeria Stock Exchange Fact book and Statistical Bulletin of the Central Bank of Nigeria on such variables like corporate social responsibility (donation), age of firms, profit after tax, and total assets. The regression model was used to achieve the objective. The result revealed that Age of Firm (t=5.103, p<0.05) and Firm Growth (t=3.289, p<0.05) were statistically significant as determinants of corporate social responsibility activities in the sector.

Keywords: Corporate Social Responsibility; Oil and Gas; Downstream; Growth
