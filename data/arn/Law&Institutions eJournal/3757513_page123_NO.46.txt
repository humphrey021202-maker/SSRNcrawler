Abstract

We examine how managers’ disclosure decisions vary in response to monetary policy shocks. Specifically, we examine the extent to which firms issue Form 8-Ks, press releases, and management forecasts following unexpected changes to the target Fed funds rate. We find consistent evidence that unexpected decreases (increases) in the FOMC target rate lead to larger increases (decreases) in disclosure by firms that are more sensitive to monetary policy shocks. Furthermore, the disclosure response to target rate surprises is concentrated in Form 8-K items that require a materiality-based decision and hold when we examine a sample of M&A-participating firms. Extended tests show that our results are not attributable to changes in the cost-of-capital leading to increased disclosure because firms are simultaneously raising capital or hyping their stock. Overall, our results are consistent with arguments raised in recent research papers that changes in cost-of-capital influence firms’ materiality thresholds, which can affect their decision to disclose.

Keywords: Disclosure, Materiality, Cost of Capital, Monetary Policy
