Abstract

This paper aims to explore the effect of voluntary discourse ESG information on corporate ﬁnancial performance and idiosyncratic risk. Previous studies obtained mixed and inconsistent findings due to the inappropriate conduct of the endogeneity issues because the voluntary disclosure of ESG information has a self-selection problem. Using a panel dataset of Taiwan listed ﬁrms by introducing a Heckman- model, we show that listed firms with voluntary ESG disclosure have higher Tobin's Q, ROA, and fewer idiosyncratic risks. Our results indicate that voluntary ESG disclosure can improve firm transparency to strengthen external governance mechanisms.

Keywords: ESG, self-selection problem, endogeneity, Heckman model, idiosyncratic risk, corporate ﬁnancial performance, external governance mechanisms
