Abstract

How does the quality and influence of advice relate to voting mistakes?  Estimates of latent proposal quality imply advisor ISS’s recommendations are wrong half the time for shareholder proposals, while management’s error rate is only 15%.  The direction of proxy advice and whether it agrees with management conveys information about ISS's precision, so shareholders make fewer mistakes than either proxy advisors or management.  Most mutual funds' votes are more informative than ISS recommendations.  Vanguard’s votes are a better benchmark for proposal quality than either ISS or even management recommendations. Our analysis implies limiting ISS’s influence would improve voting outcomes.

Keywords: shareholder voting, shareholder proposals, proxy advice, management recommendations, informed voting

JEL Classification: G30
