Abstract

This article examines how CEOs' human capital (generalist vs. specialist) influences their mergers and acquisitions decisions (M&A). We hypothesize that generalist CEOs conduct M&A to leverage their information advantages and meet their risk-taking appetite. Using the inter-regional M&A sample of China's A-share listed companies from 2008 to 2019, we found that (1) generalist CEOs are more inclined to conduct inter-region M&A; (2) the regional digitalization where acquirees located enhanced the positive association between generalist CEOs and inter-regional M&A; (3) generalist CEOs satisfies their appetite for risk-taking by conducting inter-regional M&A; (4) the positive relation is more pronounced for CEOs with a higher facial width-to-height ratio (FWHR) and firms located in regions with higher failure tolerance environment, and (5) generalist CEOs can improve acquired firms' long-term accounting and market performance, but investors do not notice this premium during the short-term event window of M&A.

Keywords: CEOs, human capital, M&A, behavioral corporate finance, corporate governance
