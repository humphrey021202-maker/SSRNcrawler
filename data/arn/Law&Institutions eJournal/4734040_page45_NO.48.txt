Abstract

This paper presents new evidence on the impacts of industrial diversification and partner business relatedness on the shareholder wealth effects of international joint ventures (IJV). By employing a comprehensive database containing worldwide joint venture announcements made by the US firms, we find evidence of diversification premium, confirming diversification through IJV investments increases shareholder value of the US partners. In comparison with partner relatedness, partner business unrelatedness can further enhance value creation from diversification. These findings have important implications for firms’ investment and partner selection decisions when they expand internationally.

Keywords: international joint ventures (IJV), foreign direct investments (FDI), industrial diversification, partner business relatedness, shareholder value
