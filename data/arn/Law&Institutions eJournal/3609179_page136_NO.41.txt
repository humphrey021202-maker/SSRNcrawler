Abstract

We examine competing theoretical hypotheses regarding the externalities caused by the systemically large banks’ decision to hold less equity. Event study tests show negative abnormal returns for non-systemically large banks following share buybacks and dividend increases announced by systemically large banks, particularly under adverse systemic conditions. Consistent with these results, two identification strategies provide causal evidence that increased leverage among systemically large banks damages the valuation and stability of non-systemically large banks. Our findings support theories suggesting that increased leverage at systemically large banks shifts risk to other banks and not theories where it makes a system-wide bailout more likely.
