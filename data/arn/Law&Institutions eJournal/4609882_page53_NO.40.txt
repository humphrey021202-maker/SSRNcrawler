Abstract

In this note, we examine whether Japanese firms use the stock price index (SPI) as a relative performance indicator in managerial compensation contracts, assuming the Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) Sector Indices, Nikkei Stock Average, and JPX-Nikkei Index 400 as potential SPIs. Our findings indicate that, except for the TSE Sector Indices, the SPI does not have a significant relationship with managerial compensation in Japan. However, the TSE Sector Stock Indices have a significant impact on managerial compensation as a relative performance indicator. We conclude that the industry factor may be crucial in the peer group setting, as proposed in traditional studies on the Japanese voluntary disclosure environment. Interestingly, although several firms that disclose the details of their management compensation contracts state the use of TOPIX in Japan, it has not been widely adopted by other non-disclosed firms.

Keywords: Managerial compensation, Relative performance evaluation, Stock price index, Peer group

JEL Classification: G34, M41
