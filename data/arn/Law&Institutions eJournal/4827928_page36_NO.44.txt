Abstract

Supervisor behavior is a critical but understudied component of management control systems. Using 286,871 employee reviews from Kununu, a major platform in German-speaking countries, we examine how middle-manager supervisor behavior responds to different forms of competitive pressure. Guided by Kotter (1990), we classify textual reviews into leadership- and management-oriented behavior using a large language model. Descriptive evidence reveals that employees more frequently and positively discuss leadership behaviors, especially trust-building, than management practices. A variance decomposition shows that both time-invariant behavioral patterns (consistent with stable supervisor traits) and dynamic, contingency-based actions are crucial components of supervisor behavior. We find that supervisor behavior correlates positively with labor market competition, suggesting strategic adaptation to retention pressure, but exhibits limited responsiveness to short-term shocks. In contrast, product market competition, measured through import tariff changes and industry sales dispersion, negatively affects leadership behavior, particularly within operational departments. Finally, we show that leadership behavior is strongly linked to lower turnover among junior employees, underscoring the long-term costs of deprioritizing relational practices under pressure. These findings suggest that competitive pressure reshapes supervisory priorities in ways that may compromise workforce stability and organizational cohesion.
