Abstract

This paper examines the effect of individual investors’ dividend taxes on managerial myopia using a unique setting of the Dividend Tax Reform in China. We find that firms facing a reduction in their individual investors’ dividends taxes are more likely to mitigate managerial myopia. Moreover, such an effect is concentrated in firms with higher investor preference, larger proportions of individual investors, and greater myopic pressures. The results indicate that differential dividends taxation induced lock-in adversely affects managerial myopia.

Keywords: Dividend tax, myopia, investor horizons, short-termism, capital gains taxes, lock-in effect
