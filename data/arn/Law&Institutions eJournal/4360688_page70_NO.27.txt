Abstract

We find that CEO turnover is significantly higher and considerably less sensitive to performance in firms with short investor horizons. Decisions to dismiss a CEO lead to worse operating performance, which is even poorer when investors have short horizons. Further, new managers respond to investor short-termism by increasing industry-adjusted capital expenditures while maintaining R\&D and patenting activity. In addition, in firms with short-horizon investors, the total risk increases around forced CEO turnovers, largely because of an increase in idiosyncratic risk. The evidence is consistent with short-term investors distorting corporate policies of firms through their influence on top management turnover.

Keywords: CEO turnover, short-term investors, investor myopia, corporate governance

JEL Classification: G30, G32
