Abstract

We examine how commercial property taxes influence business microlocation decisions by analyzing establishment-level data across U.S. county borders. Using a spatial discontinuity design and comparing for-profit to non-profit establishments, we document economically significant tax-induced location patterns. Specifically, we examine where within counties businesses choose to locate (the microlocation decision). Businesses strategically concentrate within 1 km of borders on the low-tax side while being drawn from up to 4-10 km away on the high-tax side. We observe a 6–7 (5–6) percent relocation effect in border areas with tax differentials in the top decile (quartile) over a 10 km band. Parametric analysis using polynomial estimates of counterfactual geographic distributions confirms our findings. This effect is attenuated by customer foot traffic dependence, with low-foot-traffic establishments being twice as responsive to tax differentials. Survey evidence from U.S. mayors corroborates these findings.

Keywords: property tax planning, business location decisions, cross-border tax effects JEL Classification: H25, tax avoidance, corporate tax planning, state and local taxes
