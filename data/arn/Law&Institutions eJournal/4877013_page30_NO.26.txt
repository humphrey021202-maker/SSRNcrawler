Abstract

This study examines the moderating impact of board composition on the relationship between company attributes and the performance of Deposit Money Banks in Nigeria. A hierarchical regression model consisting of hypothesised board composition, company attributes and performance were formulated and subjected to various diagnostic and robustness tests to ascertain the Best Linear Unbiased Estimators (BLUE) in the model. The analysed model output determines whether board composition moderates the relationship between company attributes with performance in Nigerian Banks and by what statistical margin of significance. The study concludes that, board composition has a significant moderating effect on the relationship between Firm Characteristics (leverage) and Corporate performance (return on equity) of listed deposit money banks in Nigeria. Further, results indicate a positive and significant impact of board size and firm size on corporate performance (return on equity), while Winsorized leverage, firm age and board composition indicate a negative but significant effect on corporate performance (return on equity). These results support the Agency notion, which entails practical proof of the positive impact of board characteristics and firm attributes on corporate performance. This study recommends that the board composition structure of the Nigerian Banks be expanded as an industry requirement with a view to create more legitimacy that may perhaps spur sustainable performance measures be taken by board of directors; so that the interests of the Banks are aligned with other stakeholders in the society.
