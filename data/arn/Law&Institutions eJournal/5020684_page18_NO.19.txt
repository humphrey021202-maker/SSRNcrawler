Abstract

This study investigates the extent to which corporate boards prioritize biodiversity-related information disclosure within their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) frameworks. With growing global emphasis on biodiversity conservation and sustainable development, companies are under increasing pressure to disclose their impacts on ecosystems. This research explores whether boards effectively integrate biodiversity concerns into their governance structures and whether such disclosures are meaningful or merely symbolic. The study employs a mixed-methods approach, combining content analysis of biodiversity-related disclosures in annual and sustainability reports of publicly listed companies with in-depth interviews of board members and sustainability officers. A sample of companies from diverse sectors, including energy, agriculture, and manufacturing, is analyzed to provide a broad understanding of disclosure practices. Findings reveal that biodiversity disclosure remains underdeveloped compared to other ESG factors like carbon emissions or water usage. Boards show varying levels of engagement, with some viewing biodiversity as a secondary issue, while a few leading firms in environmentally sensitive sectors demonstrate a proactive stance. Factors influencing the extent of biodiversity disclosure include environmentally knowledgeable board members, stakeholder pressure, and regulatory environments. However, many disclosures lack specific metrics or action plans, raising concerns about the effectiveness of such reporting in driving tangible biodiversity outcomes. This study contributes original insights by addressing a largely overlooked aspect of ESG reportingbiodiversity. It highlights the need for enhanced board awareness and governance mechanisms that incorporate biodiversity into corporate strategies. The research calls for clearer regulatory guidelines and increased stakeholder engagement to foster more meaningful biodiversity-related disclosures.
