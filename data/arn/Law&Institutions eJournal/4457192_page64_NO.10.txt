Abstract

How do bankers treat green firms? Using unique loan application and banker preference data from a mid sized bank, we find that customer managers, serving as front-line bankers, give more favorable recommendations to green firms, especially when they hold green values themselves. However, a minority of environmentally skeptical loan officers, aware through internal training that customer managers generally have greener preferences, counter this by downgrading positive evaluations of green firms. Despite not knowing the customer manager’s identity, these officers use their discretion to mitigate what they perceive as green biases, demonstrating the significant moderating role of superiors within the banking hierarchy.

Keywords: Green bank lending, customer managers, loan officers, values, beliefs, subjective information JEL Codes: G21, hierarchy

JEL Classification: G21
