Abstract

Awareness to climate risk and the associated environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing (ESG awareness) is important for green asset pricing, but its determinants remain largely unexplored. Utilizing a proprietary dataset from a largescale survey in 2022 on 18,031 stock investors, we find financial literacy can significantly increase investors' ESG awareness. This positive relationship is more pronounced for individual investors and robust for alternative samples and measures of ESG awareness and financial literacy. Further analysis shows that individualexperience-based sources of financial literacy have stronger effect on ESG awareness than institution-based sources. Mechanism analysis reveals that financial literacy enhances the ESG awareness of investors with high risk tolerance, suggesting a possible better understanding of risks among those investors. We also show that financial literacy does not facilitate investors' comprehension of financial advice from experts. For active ESG investors, financial literacy improves their stock returns.

Keywords: ESG awareness, financial literacy, ESG investing, financial advice, risk and return perception
