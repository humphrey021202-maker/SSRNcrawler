Abstract

Prior studies suggest that industry clustering, the phenomenon where industry-peer firms are geographically co-located, decreases analysts’ acquisition costs and leads to greater stock price efficiency for firms within industry clusters. Since market participants and analysts are financial reporting environment users and accounting information is the fundamental source of information within the financial reporting environment, I predict that analysts and market participants experience industry clustering benefits via enhanced accounting information quality. Consequently, I examine whether industry clustering improves accounting information quality. I find that industry clustering is positively associated with accounting information quality. Consistent with prior research, I find that this association is more prevalent when firms have greater discretionary control over accruals and also when firms are in more highly concentrated industries. Overall, my findings suggest that industry clustering enhances accounting information quality, and that the financial reporting environment is perhaps a channel through which industry clustering benefits both firms and information intermediaries.

Keywords: industry clusters, accrual quality, knowledge spillover, financial reporting environment
