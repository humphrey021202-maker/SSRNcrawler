Abstract

Using a controlled laboratory experiment, we investigate the causal effects of financial reporting regulation, providing comprehensive evidence along the entire causal path from regulatory changes to disclosure outcomes and economic consequences. We examine two types of financial reporting regulations: limits on earnings management and the possibility of auditing. Our findings indicate that a tight limit and the possibility of an audit enhance the informativeness of earnings disclosures, leading to improved pricing efficiency. Conversely, a weak limit fails to differentiate high-earning from low-earning managers, resulting in lower disclosure quality and greater pricing inefficiency. Furthermore, we identify two distinct mechanisms by which financial reporting regulations enhance disclosure quality: constraining earnings management practices and inducing signaling behavior. Among the treatments, the most remarkable welfare improvement and better-protected investors' interests are observed in the auditing treatment, where earnings management is most effectively suppressed. In contrast, treatments with limits induce over-investment in costly signals, i.e., aggressive earnings management by high-earning managers, which discourages market trading and reduces market welfare. Our results highlight the critical role of financial reporting regulation in determining market efficiency and shed light on previously contradictory empirical findings regarding financial reporting regulations.

Keywords: Financial reporting regulation, Earnings management, Pricing efficiency, Welfare analysis
