Abstract

To date, investors' efforts to ‘look inside’ a company’s culture have been hampered by a lack of data. This study seeks to overcome these limitations by employing a computational linguistics technique to infer employees’ perceptions from social media. Our study highlights the merits of textual analysis for automated corporate culture analysis and builds on the growing body of evidence which suggests that intangible information is not fully exploited by investors.

Keywords: corporate culture, text analysis

JEL Classification: G10, G14, J3, L21
