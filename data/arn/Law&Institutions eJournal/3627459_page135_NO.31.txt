Abstract

We document a causal negative relation between algorithmic trading (AT) and analyst research production, as captured by the frequency of earnings forecasts and stock recommendations and by analyst coverage. This evidence reflects that AT increases the speed of price discovery, which reduces the profitability of trades on analyst research by short-term fundamental investors and, consequently, their demand for analyst investment advice. The negative effect AT has on analyst research production is moderated when investors use analyst research for monitoring rather than trading purpose. The analysis demonstrates that AT can affect firms’ information environment through their impact on analyst research production.

Keywords: high frequency trading; analyst coverage; earnings forecasts; stock recommendations

JEL Classification: D53; G12; G14; M41
