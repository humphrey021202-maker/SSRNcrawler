Abstract

Using a hand-coded sample of over 45,000 CEO compensation performance plans from 1998 to 2023, we conduct a pioneering analysis of the use of human capital-based (HC) performance metrics in CEO pay. In our sample, the percentage of firms adopting HC-based plans rose from 4% in 1998 to 57% in 2023. The magnitude of pay values under HC plans has also increased from around 0.1 times salary in 1998 to over 1.8 times salary in 2023. Firms with larger workforces and greater reliance on human capital are more likely to adopt HC plans and to grant higher pay values under these plans. HC performance metrics are classified into three types: Health and Safety (HS), Talent and Culture (TC), and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI). While HC plans exist in all industries, most firms adopt just one type. About two-thirds of HS plans use quantitative metrics, compared with 43% of DEI plans and only 18% of TC plans. There are notable jumps in the prevalence of TC plans in 2018 and of DEI plans in 2021; these jumps align with shifts in investor perspectives and preferences. Interestingly, CEOs with DEI plans based on qualitative metrics, HC plans with multiple metric types, and HC plans with a high number of metrics, receive significantly higher pay (without delivering better firm performance) than CEOs without HC plans. This raises concerns about agency problems in firms that adopt HC plans with characteristics that are inherently difficult for shareholders to monitor. Overall, our findings challenge the common practice of lumping E, S, and G metrics together and highlight the need to analyze each type of incentive metric separately.
