Abstract

We document important links between targets' institutional ownership and takeover-bid outcomes. Firms' institutional ownership increases the likelihood of receiving stock-for-stock bids. The impact becomes stronger when information asymmetries are higher, whereas we find little support for alternative channels such as bidder misvaluation or target-side adverse selection. The information channel is further buttressed in our analyses of institutions' share-retention decisions, targets' demand for top-tier advisors, collar provisions, and targets' share of expected synergies. Our findings suggest that institutions' information advantage facilitates rational payment design (Eckbo, Makaew, and Thorburn, 2018) and targets' bargaining power gains, alleviating deadweight losses associated with stock-for-stock offers.

Keywords: institutional ownership, mergers and acquisitions, payment methods, information asymmetry

JEL Classification: G23, G32, G34
