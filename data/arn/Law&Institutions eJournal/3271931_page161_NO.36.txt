Abstract

Prior research finds that shareholder-level taxes can affect dividend policy, but does not consider whether this relation varies a) when conflicts exist between tax incentives of insiders versus other investors or b) with shareholders' monitoring role. We find that taxable insiders encourage special dividends before tax increases ("tax-motivated special dividends") even when most institutional owners do not obtain tax benefits from these payments, indicating that insiders' tax preferences dominate institutions' conflicting tax preferences. However, monitoring tax-insensitive institutions constrain insiders' ability to pay these dividends for insiders' own benefit but encourage payments for the benefit of other non-insider tax-sensitive investors. In sum, insiders' taxes matter, except when tax-insensitive institutions act as monitors. Our study highlights the importance of considering heterogeneous tax and non-tax shareholder attributes when academics and policymakers evaluate how taxes affect dividends. We also document a previously unidentified role of institutional monitoring in the relation between shareholder-level taxes and managers' dividend decisions.
