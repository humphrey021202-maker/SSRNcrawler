Abstract

This study examines whether forward-looking rank-and-file employee expectations of firms' business outlooks are associated with auditors' first-time going concern opinions. The findings show that forward-looking pessimistic expectations of future business outlooks by current employees increase the likelihood of auditors' first-time going concern opinions, above and beyond the effect of backward-looking employee workplace satisfaction ratings. In addition, employee expectations of firms' business outlooks improve ex-post accuracy in auditors' firsttime going concern opinions through reduced Type I and Type II misclassifications. Additional analyses suggest that employee expectations of firms' business outlooks can serve as one-yearahead early warning signals of first-time going concern opinions. Overall, expectations by rankand-file employees are incrementally informative to auditors when assessing clients' first-time going concern status.

Keywords: employees, business outlook, going concern
