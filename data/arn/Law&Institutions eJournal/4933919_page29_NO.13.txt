Abstract

Based on panel data from 46 countries, we provide a global view of the relationship between ESG ratings and investment efficiency under the standard Fazzari-Huber-Petersen framework. Firms with higher ESG ratings deviate from traditional investment opportunities, leading to potential resource misallocation, particularly in developed markets. In contrast, high ESG ratings in emerging markets are associated with easing financial constraints and do not induce misallocation. Furthermore, the misallocation is more pronounced in regions where stakeholders and financiers place a higher value on ESG matters. Where ESG ratings weaken the relationship between investment and traditional opportunities, investment becomes more closely aligned with ESG-related investment opportunities. These results are consistent with the view that firms in emerging markets strive to achieve high ESG scores to obtain additional funding to reduce underinvestment. Firms in advanced economies face only negative consequences on investment efficiency because they are generally already at optimal investment levels and are less capable of mitigating stakeholder pressure or managerial agency issues.

Keywords: ESG ratings, investment efficiency, financial constraints, Corporate governance
