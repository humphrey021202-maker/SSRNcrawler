Abstract

Businesses are increasingly embracing the dynamics of new digital technologies, as they communicate their policies and responsible initiatives through corporate websites, social media platforms and other interactive channels. The Web 2.0 is also considered as a vehicle for the marketing communications of laudable practices, including non-financial reporting. In this light, the methodology integrates measures from technological innovation and corporate social responsibility (CSR) to understand the rationale for using digital media to communicate about environmental, social and governance issues. A quantitative study amongst 202 owner-managers in the retail industry indicated that there is a positive and significant relationship between the perceived the ease of use and perceived usefulness of online media (for CSR disclosures) and stakeholder engagement. In addition, the findings revealed that the younger respondents were increasingly engaging in ubiquitous technologies. In conclusion, this contribution suggests that CSR communication is more effective when it is readily available online. It implies that there are opportunities for businesses to enhance their reputation and image as they engage with different stakeholders through digital media.

Keywords: CSR, Corporate Social Responsibility, Digital Media, Online CSR reporting, Technology Acceptance Model, Pace of Technological Innovation, CSR measures
