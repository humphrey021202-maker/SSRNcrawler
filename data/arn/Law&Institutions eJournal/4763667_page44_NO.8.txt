Abstract

As Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria become increasingly influential in investment decisions, there is a growing concern about "greenwashing" - deceptive practices by companies to appear environmentally and socially responsible. This study examines the role of hometown CEOs in mitigating greenwashing within Chinese listed firms. Our findings reveal that hometown CEOs effectively reduce greenwashing by enhancing disclosure practices rather than actual performance. Our results primarily in line with the social identity theory, rather than place identity and place attachment theory. This research offers actionable insights for policymakers and corporations, emphasizing the significance of leadership characteristics informed by place-based identity theories in combating greenwashing.

Keywords: Greenwash, Hometown CEOs, ESG disclosure, ESG performance
