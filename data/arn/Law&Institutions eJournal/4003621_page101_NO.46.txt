Abstract

This study introduces a financial statement fraud detection approach designed for real-time application, addressing the challenge posed by the prevalence of unrevealed fraud. Traditional models rely on future knowledge of fraud incidents for retrospective detection, a scenario unrealistic for real-time applications where most fraud remains undetected and mislabeled. We first empirically assess the extent to which existing models deteriorate in performance when applied in a re-constructed real-time detection setting, where future information of fraud is excluded from model training. To address this limitation, we propose a machine learning method uniquely designed to account for the delayed identification of financial statement fraud by estimating selection bias. Our results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing approaches in real-time fraud detection, enhancing detection accuracy and costeffectiveness in real-time settings. This research provides the first evidence of the impact of undetected fraud on the model performance and introduces an effective method for real-time fraud detection, offering significant implications for both academia and practitioners.
