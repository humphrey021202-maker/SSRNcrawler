Abstract

Decentralized finance (DeFi) transactions are typically executed using a special digital
class of contracts called smart contracts. These contracts are self-executing and hardcoded
directly on a blockchain. We observe the emergence of a new class of voluntary
audits that evaluate the integrity of these contracts. Using a hand-coded sample of
about 8,500 smart contract audit reports, we provide some of the first evidence showing
that (1) these audits are pervasive, (2) the audit firm market is predominantly
composed of new technical audit firms, (3) the scope of these audits can span a variety
of contract features, (4) the audit inputs and outputs differ substantively from those
of conventional financial audits, and (5) the market reacts positively to the release of
these audit reports, suggesting that these reports are value-relevant. These findings
highlight the demand for novel assurance services driven by blockchain technology.

Keywords: Auditing, Decentralized Finance, Smart Contracts
