Abstract

Biotechnology companies experience dramatic shifts in their financial statements as their clinical programs progress through the stages of drug development. This paper analyzes how a company’s income statement and balance sheet evolve from preclinical research through commercialization, with a focus on U.S. GAAP principles such as ASC 730, ASC 606, and ASC 330. Using Moderna Inc. as a case study, the paper demonstrates how development milestones, such as the initiation of Phase III trials or product launch, directly impact expense recognition, inventory accounting, revenue reporting, and gross margin visibility. These observable changes provide critical financial signals to investors, auditors, and internal finance teams. The study oƯers a practical framework for interpreting financial statements in biotech and life sciences sectors, helping stakeholders align accounting expectations with scientific progress.
