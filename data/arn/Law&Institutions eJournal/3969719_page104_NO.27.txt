Abstract

This study investigates whether and how the amount of firm-specific information incorporated into stock prices changes when there is more quarterly, rather than semi-annual, reporting in the peer group. Using a sample of 33,338 European firm-year observations from 2004 to 2017, we find a significantly negative relation between stock price synchronicity and concentration of quarterly reporting among a firm’s peers. We argue that more public peer disclosure stimulates acquisition of private firm-specific information. Additional tests show that the negative relation is strongest among firms with semi-annual reporting, opaque earnings, and low institutional ownership. We further decompose the synchronicity measure into market and industry co-movement and find that the former is decreasing while the latter is increasing with more frequent peer reporting.

Keywords: financial reporting frequency, positive externalities, stock price synchronicity

JEL Classification: M41, M48, G14
