Abstract

We provide the first evidence after Regulation G on firms’ non-GAAP EPS denominator choices and whether they provide useful information or are opportunistic. From 2013-2019, 17 percent of annual non-GAAP EPS numbers use denominators different from that of GAAP diluted EPS, which makes denominator adjustments among the most prevalent individual types of non-GAAP adjustments. For firms reporting GAAP and non-GAAP profits or GAAP losses and non-GAAP profits, we provide evidence consistent with denominator adjustments increasing non-GAAP EPS informativeness. Our evidence also suggests that opportunism in denominator choices is concentrated in firms reporting GAAP losses and non-GAAP profits and failing to adjust the denominator. Such non-adjustment is inconsistent with SEC requirements to report non-GAAP EPS “on a diluted basis” because the EPS denominator for a GAAP loss excludes dilutive claims. While the SEC largely overlooks such firms, they are more likely, on average, to report non-GAAP EPS that analysts consider inflated.

Keywords: non-GAAP financial measures; non-GAAP EPS; denominator; GAAP diluted EPS; voluntary disclosure; SEC comment letters

JEL Classification: M40; M41; M48
