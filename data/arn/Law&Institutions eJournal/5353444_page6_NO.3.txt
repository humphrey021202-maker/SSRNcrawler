Abstract

The climate and ecological crises pose complex and far-reaching challenges for human societies, highlighting the critical role of scientific research in supporting evidence-based policymaking. In this context, we investigate whether financial reporting standards can play a role in addressing these challenges. Specifically, we examine how variations in financial reporting frameworks influence corporate investment behaviour and, through this channel, shape corporate pathways for climate change mitigation. Using the European Union as a case study, our analysis suggests that financial accounting standards can exert a meaningful “inside-out” influence on climate mitigation outcomes. These findings provide valuable insights for policymakers seeking to align economic regulation with climate objectives. Furthermore, the study underscores the need to incorporate the effects of alternative financial reporting standards into macro-financial models that capture how heterogeneous firms’ investment decisions impact climate transition risks.

Keywords: Climate Change Mitigation, Financial Reporting, Corporate Investment, Short Termism, GHG emissions
