Abstract

We track the employment histories of over 6,000 chief executive officers (CEOs) and study how their past litigation experiences affect corporate voluntary disclosure. We define litigation experience to be any securities class action experienced during a CEO's early career in non-CEO positions and in other firms. We find that firms managed by litigation-experienced CEOs provide more management forecasts than other firms. The positive effects are further identified by using a matched sample design and exploiting CEO turnover events. We also find that litigation-experienced CEOs provide more timely forecasts and are more likely to provide range forecasts. Moreover, market reactions to their earnings forecasts are stronger. Collectively, the evidence indicates that early career litigation exposure leads managers to improve both the quantity and quality of their voluntary disclosures.

Keywords: CEOs, decision from experience, litigation, management forecasts, disclosure

JEL Classification: M40, M41, K22
