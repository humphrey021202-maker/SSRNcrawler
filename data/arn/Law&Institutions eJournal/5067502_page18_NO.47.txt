Abstract

The Market Abuse Regulation (MAR), implemented in July 2016 across the EU, mandates uniform closed periods, prohibiting insider trading 30 days before earnings announcements. We find a significant reduction in insider trading during these periods in treated countries without prior mandates. Although some trades still occur, they do not appear to be driven by private information. However, treated insiders experience an increase in compensation. Furthermore, information asymmetry rises before earnings announcements, and treated firms experience a decline in institutional ownership. Overall, the study suggests that mandated closed periods do not lead to a wealth transfer from insiders to outsiders, nor do they enhance the information environment. These results underscore the limitations of regulatory one-size-fits-all measures in curbing corporate insider trading.
