Abstract

This paper examines how institutional characteristics influence the association between board connectedness and corporate social responsibility (CSR). We show that the impact of board connectedness on CSR is largely shaped by institutional ownership. Additionally, our research demonstrates that the positive effect of board connectedness on CSR is primarily driven by institutional investors with more diversified portfolios, including transient and quasi-index institutions, as well as independent institutions like mutual funds and investment companies. However, for firms with institutional holdings featuring more concentrated portfolios (such as dedicated or grey institutions), the effect of board connectedness on CSR is less pronounced. These results suggest that institutional characteristics play a crucial role in determining the effectiveness of board interlocks, and they significantly modify the link between board connectedness and CSR.

Keywords: board connectedness, board interlocks, corporate social responsibility, institutional investors, institutional ownership
