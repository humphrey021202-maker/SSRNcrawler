Value-Adding Impact of Female Directors on ESG Performance Equality

Abstract

This study examines whether female directors place greater emphasis on different ESG performance equality. Analyzing reforms from 26 countries that mandate firms to improve gender diversity on boards, we find that these reforms increase performance equality across different ESG performance. These results are more pronounced for firms in countries with stricter legal enforcement, stronger disclosure requirements, and higher respect for women's rights. Furthermore, our results are more significant for firms that increased the percentage of female directors after the reforms. Additionally, we find that the improvement in performance equality not only enhances firm value but also decreases the firms' negative ESG reputation after the reforms. Overall, our findings shed new light on a major benefit of having female directors: focusing on performance equality across different ESG dimensions, which increases firm value and mitigates reputation damage.

Keywords: Boardroom gender diversity reforms, ESG Performance Equality, Female directors
