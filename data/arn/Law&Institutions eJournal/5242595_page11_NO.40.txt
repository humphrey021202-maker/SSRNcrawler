Abstract

This study explores strategies to reduce the financial audit expectation gap in high-corruption environment, where differing perceptions of auditors' responsibilities and capabilities among stakeholders create significant challenges for practitioners and academia. Auditors must demonstrate their value in meeting investor and public demands as part of market-driven governance, rather than merely complying with regulatory requirements. Grounded in agency theory, fraud-triangle theory, and institutional theory, this study examines the factors that influence external auditors to detect material misstatements due to fraud and corruption in construction financial statement audits. These factors were found through a literature review, incorporated into a questionnaire, and extracted using exploratory factor analysis. We found 11 factors that significantly impact audit effectiveness: professionalism, empathy, whistleblowing propensity, government support, demography, client governance, audit experience, audit fees, audit role, educational quality, and personal consequences. These findings were validated through interviews and focus group discussions (FGDs), leading to the development of a framework to bridge the audit expectation gap. The framework proposes three alternative solutions: business (commercial entrepreneurs, social entrepreneurship, and policy recommendations. Overall, it offers practical insights to enhance auditor effectiveness, align stakeholder expectations, and mitigate audit risks in a high-corruption environment.

Keywords: audit expectation gaps, Corruption, construction and property, entrepreneurs, Policy
