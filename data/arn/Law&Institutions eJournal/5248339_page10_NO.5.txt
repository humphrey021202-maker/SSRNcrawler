Abstract

Over the past decade, diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) have emerged as central themes in corporate governance and disclosure, culminating in the SEC's principles-based human capital disclosure regulation in August 2020, which requires registrants to describe their human capital resources and any material measures or objectives but does not prescribe specific metrics thereby granting firms broad discretion and leaving disclosures vulnerable to shifts in political and social currents. When this mandate took effect for Form 10-K filings on or after November 9, 2020, companies responded with a marked increase in human capital and DEI language, yet in the aftermath of the 2024 presidential election many S&P 500 firms recalibrated or pared back their DEI narratives in Item 1, reflecting the regulation's inherent flexibility amid changing political winds.
