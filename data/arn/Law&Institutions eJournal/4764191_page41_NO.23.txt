Abstract

The distribution inequality between increasing shareholder payouts and stagnant wages has recently attracted attention. Only a few studies, however, have explored the factors driving this phenomenon. This study examines whether national-level corporate governance reforms worsen this inequality using unique firm-level wage data and an exogenous institutional change in Japan. Employing a difference-in-differences methodology, I find that Japanese corporate governance reform increases distribution inequality by boosting payouts, particularly share repurchases, while having little impact on wages. The findings indicate that corporate governance reforms, which are often claimed to support sustainable growth, might have created economic inequality.

Keywords: Corporate governance, Governance reforms, Payout policy, Distribution inequality
