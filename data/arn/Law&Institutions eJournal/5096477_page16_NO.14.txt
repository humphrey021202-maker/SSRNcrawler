Abstract

Corporate  Social  Responsibility  refers  to  the  policies  and  practices  that  are  generally undertaken by businesses (or corporations) in order to add a positive influence upon the society at large. The concept of CSR is benevolent in nature and contradicts with the traditional approach of businesses, i.e. profit-seeking. However, like many western countries, India too had come up with the Companies Act, 2013, making it a mandate for the companies to donate a certain portion of their profits to the societal good.

This study attempts to find out the factors impacting CSR spending expenditure using annual data from 2014-15 to 2022-23. A Regression analysis has been done in the study to analyse the influence of the factors which affect CSR spending of Indian companies. Results reveal that current ratio and firm size exhibits a significant positive impact on CSR spending whereas, the impact of PAT and Diluted EPS was significantly negative.
