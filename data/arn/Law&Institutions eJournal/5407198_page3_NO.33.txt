Abstract

I develop a hybrid accountability framework to explain how artificial intelligence redistributes responsibility across human professionals, algorithmic systems, vendors, and institutions in accounting. I synthesise evidence across audit and assurance, financial reporting and analytics, ESG reporting and ethical accountability, and governance and management control. I show that AI expands analytical reach and efficiency yet introduces new opacity, role ambiguity, and ethical risk. I integrate major international policy developments including the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive and the AI Act, the ISSB S1 and S2 standards, and emerging approaches in the United States and China, and I highlight algorithmic risks such as greenwashing and ESG rating divergence. The review contributes theoretically by reframing accountability as a distributed sociotechnical construct and by clarifying how professional judgement, internal control, and institutional legitimacy are renegotiated in AI enabled settings. It also offers practical guidance that centres human in the loop oversight, explainable AI, and cross functional governance, and it advances a forward looking research agenda that prioritises explainability, networked responsibility, professional identity, regulatory experimentation, and public trust. I position hybrid accountability as a unifying concept for understanding and steering AI enabled change in accounting.

Keywords: artificial intelligence, hybrid accountability, audit and assurance, Financial reporting, ESG reporting, governance and management control
