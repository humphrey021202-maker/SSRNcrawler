Abstract

This paper investigates the relation between trade credit and corporate business strategy. Using the Miles and Snow (1978, 2003) typology, we find that firms following a defender (prospector) type-strategy have less (more) trade credit compared with firms that follow an analyzer type-strategy. This result, which is based on variability in conditional conservatism, remains robust using different measures of trade credit and corporate business strategy, as well as several endogeneity tests, including firm fixed effects (FE), propensity score matching (PSM), entropy-balancing, and generalized method of moments (GMM). Our results show that corporate business strategy is a valuable tool that can be used to evaluate client trade credit, suggesting that trade credit is a significant area for enhancement amongst prospector-like clients.

Keywords: Trade credit, Corporate business strategy, Conditional conservatism, Entropy-balancing
