Abstract

Using a large sample of US-listed firms, we examine how firms’ dividend payout decisions are influenced by the decisions of their local peers. We show that the decision to increase, initiate and decrease dividends are all influenced by the dividend decisions of local peers. We find local peer effects to be more pronounced for firms exposed to greater local retail and local institutional investor demand and in geographies where dividend payouts are highly concentrated between locally competing firms. Overall, our findings suggest that local peer effects arise due to the presence of local dividend demand and supply-side pressures.


Keywords: Dividend Payouts, Local Peer Influence, Dividend Clienteles, Geography.
