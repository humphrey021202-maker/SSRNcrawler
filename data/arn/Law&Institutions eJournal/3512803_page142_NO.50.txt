Abstract

Corporate governance in developing countries is becoming noticeable in the extant literature. In this chapter, we review the development of the corporate governance discourse in Nigeria, paying attention to the challenges of promoting good governance standards through reforms. Relying on institutional theory as against the widely-engaged agency framework, we account for the institutional determinants of corporate governance reforms in Nigeria. We analyse the intricacies of the institutional context in developing countries and their complementarity (or deviance) with the prevailing corporate governance regulatory system.
