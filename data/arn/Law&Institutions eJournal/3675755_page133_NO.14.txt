Abstract

The optimal view of managerial power theory suggests that boards reward CEOs with power for good firm performance. However, firm performance can be decomposed into CEO skill and luck. Economic theory predicts that, in evaluating the CEO’s ability, boards filter out luck from performance. Contrary to the prediction, I find that luck significantly increases the power of CEOs, whereas skill has a limited effect. I explore four channels that could explain why power for luck arises: market timing, luck increasing CEOs' outside options, substitution effects between power and pay, and inability of boards to filter out luck.

Keywords: CEO power, relative performance evaluation, corporate governance, pay for luck
