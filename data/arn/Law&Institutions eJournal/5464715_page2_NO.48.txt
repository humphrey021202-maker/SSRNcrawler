Abstract

Investment managers often face short-term incentives, such as redemption pressure following recent weak performance, that discourage them from holding positions through temporary underperformance. These constraints can lead to systematic underinvestment in firms that require longer holding periods to realize value. We examine whether these horizon-driven frictions generate predictable return patterns across firms. We measure long-term ownership at the firm level using active managers' share-weighted holding periods (Horizon), and document that firms with longer Horizon generate significantly higher returns than those with shorter Horizon, particularly among stocks that are harder for myopic managers to hold. We exploit the 2004 SEC rule that increased mutual fund disclosure frequency to link our findings to myopia. We find that Treated firms experienced declines in Horizon and a stronger Horizon-return relation, consistent with increased myopia reducing long-termism and increasing mispricing. In contrast, we find no change in the Horizon-return relation following the XBRL mandate, which improved access to fundamental information but did not affect investor constraints. These results suggest that frictions in institutional holding horizons, not information-processing advantages, drive the observed returns to long-term investing.
