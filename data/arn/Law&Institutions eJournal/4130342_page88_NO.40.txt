Abstract

This study provides novel evidence on the impact of policy uncertainty on acquisitions using detailed, hand-collected information on private merger negotiations between targets and competing bidders around U.S. corporate tax reform in 2017. Over a legislative process marked by elevated uncertainty about future tax laws, targets secure upward bid revisions during private negotiations that compensate their shareholders for the expected gain from potential tax laws; the effect is concentrated in deals agreed to before uncertainty about the reform is resolved. Bidders offer these tax-driven increases in the purchase price within a few days of legislative events and when they face more pressure to complete the deal. Target CEO involvement in deal negotiations explains tax-driven increases in bid prices during tax reform, particularly among CEOs with greater incentive alignment.
