Abstract

Corporate Accounting contributes to the literature by offering detailed analyses of how corporations manage, report, and audit their financial activities. It explores complex areas like financial statement preparation, consolidation, mergers and acquisitions, and corporate governance, providing frameworks and standards that ensure transparency and accountability. The literature on Corporate Accounting also examines the implications of regulatory changes, international financial reporting standards (IFRS), and the role of corporate accounting in strategic decision-making, thus enhancing our understanding of corporate financial practices and their broader economic impact.

Keywords: Accounting, Corporate Accounting
