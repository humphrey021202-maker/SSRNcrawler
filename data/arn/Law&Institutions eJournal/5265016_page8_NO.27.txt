Abstract

Using a sample of 13,607 firms from 50 countries during 2000-2022, we document that CEO ability increases the tendency to commit fraud. This relationship appears to be driven by high-ability CEOs' greater willingness to take risks when faced with more aggressive and demanding performance targets. This positive effect is heightened by CEO power but alleviated by better corporate governance quality. External governance factors, including national culture and the legal and institutional environment, also play a moderating role in this relationship. Our findings are economically significant: one standard deviation increase in CEO ability is associated with 6.6% increase in fraud tendency. Our findings remain robust across multiple sensitivity analyses, including addressing endogeneity concerns, and have several policy implications.

Keywords: CEO characteristics, corporate fraud, CEO ability, CEO power, national culture, legal environment, fraud risk
