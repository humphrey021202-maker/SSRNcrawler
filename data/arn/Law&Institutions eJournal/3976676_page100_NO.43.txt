Abstract

Share premium has been one of the longstanding controversial topics in the financial accounting and corporate law with heavy debates for listed companies which are subjected to intense scrutiny. One of the major changes in the Malawi Companies Act 2013 was the abolition of issuance of shares at par value which met heavy resistance from the accountants’ body. The literature review however demonstrated that share premium was subject to more abuse for more than a century across the global. The findings of this study have identified several weaknesses in accounting for share premium by Malawian listed companies who undertook public offerings between 2016 and 2020 with possible violations of the Malawi Companies Act 2013 and International Financial Reporting Standards. Further investigations are recommended from the results of this study to sanitise the Malawi capital markets.
