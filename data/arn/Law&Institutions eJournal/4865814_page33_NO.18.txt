Abstract

The study examines whether effective tax rates (ETRs) are used to maximize the firms' cash flow consequences of earnings in Brazil, Chile, Mexico, and Peru. The sample consists of 92 firms from 2009 to 2019, and the study finds that ETRs are positively associated with earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). The interaction between ETRs and book-tax differences also affects EBITDA. In Chile, taxable income is a good benchmark for financial reporting income because of regulators' strong enforcement of tax laws and the mandatory dividend protection afforded to minority shareholders. In Brazil and the entire sample, foreign institutional ownership helps achieve greater convergence between taxable income and financial reporting income. The study suggests that, despite the highly concentrated insider ownership levels, by stringently enforcing the laws and promoting foreign institutional ownership in listed companies in Latin American code-law countries, the greater convergence in taxable income and financial reporting income could help protect minority shareholders.

Keywords: Latin America, Effective tax rates, Tax Planning, Ownership concentration, Cash flows
