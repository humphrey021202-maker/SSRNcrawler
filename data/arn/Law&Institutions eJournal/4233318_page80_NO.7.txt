Abstract

We explore how low-cost activism threats influence firms' tax avoidance. Lacking private information, non-blockholders may respond to poor earnings with low-cost activism, which harms managers’ careers, prompting them to opportunistically increase tax avoidance to improve earnings and preempt such activism. We find a positive association between low-cost activism threats and tax avoidance, supported by tests addressing endogeneity concerns. This association is more robust in less transparent firms, and the heightened tax avoidance associated with such threats increases stock-price crash risk. Our evidence suggests that low-cost activism threats, as a type of investor pressure, exacerbate managers’ opportunistic use of tax avoidance.

Keywords: Low-cost activism threats, Non-blockholders, Lack of private information, Corporate tax avoidance, Managerial opportunism

JEL Classification: G32, H26, M41
