Abstract

The ownership of competing firms by investment funds, or common ownership, can cause anti-competitive product market outcomes. This paper examines the price effects of common ownership in the Western Australian (WA) retail gasoline market. Using a rich data set of daily, station-level petrol prices, I exploit the acquisition of Puma Energy by Chevron which delivered a significant shock to common ownership in the market. Through a difference-in-differences framework, I estimate that prices increased by 1.54 cents per litre on average in stations that had increased common ownership relative to unaffected stations, representing a 20% increase in margins.

Keywords: antitrust, anti-competitive, common ownership, corporate governance, institutional investors, oligopoly, retail gasoline
