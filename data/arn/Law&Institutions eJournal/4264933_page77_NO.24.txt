Abstract

We introduce a novel measure of executive visibility and demonstrate its influence in attracting
retail investors to Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs). Visible executives
raise larger SPACs in less time and garner greater investor interest at merger announcement
compared to those less visible. Retail investors actively trade based on executive visibility,
perceiving it as a signal of SPAC quality. Their decisions are guided by institutional investors
who, benefiting from early access to SPACs and leveraging the biases of retail investors, sell
their shares to their less sophisticated counterparts, thereby securing a well-timed exit prior to
merger completion.

Keywords: Executives, Visibility, Reputation, SPACs

JEL Classification: D83, G19, G34, M12
