Abstract

In recent years, scholars and policymakers have become interested in the idea of a smart mix of voluntary and regulatory measures in private governance. If public and private actors are to share the work load of governing the commons, this presupposes that both sides can agree on this compromise formula – but can they? So far, we have limited knowledge of ﬁrms and business associations’ regulatory preferences in this realm. As a ground-clearing exercise my article aims to help ﬁll this gap and expose some of the underappreciated fault and conﬂict lines within private governance. Its thrust is that existing literature is excessively optimistic about business’s willingness to support regulation. The article surveys the EU’s non-ﬁnancial disclosure Directive 2014/95/EU and half a dozen other attempts to regulate CSR or non-ﬁnancial disclosure across the world (sections 1502 and 1504 of the US Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform Act, South Africa’s King Codes, the 2009 2% clause in Mauritius, Section 135 of India's Companies Act 2013, Article 74 of Indonesia's 2007 Companies Law) and ﬁnds that public authorities’ more ambitious attempts at regulation met with vigorous business opposition. Even after the ﬁnancial crisis, most business associations and ﬁrms reject a smart mix in favor of voluntarism and soft law without hard sanctions.
