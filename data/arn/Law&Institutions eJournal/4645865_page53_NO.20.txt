Abstract

By using generative AI to analyze narrative disclosures related to tax audits, we develop a novel firm-year measure identifying periods of tax audit enforcement. Our measure exhibits substantial within-firm variation and closely aligns with the official IRS data. Leveraging this measure, we address several key questions regarding the tax implications of audits. First, we document that firms significantly reduce their tax avoidance activities during tax audits and that this reduction persists even after the audit's conclusion. Second, we demonstrate that non-audited firms proactively decrease their tax avoidance behaviors in response to audits conducted on economically connected peer firms. Notably, the economic magnitude of this indirect deterrence effect amounts to approximately 50%-60% of the direct deterrence effect. Furthermore, we find that the deterrence effect of tax audits intensifies when audited firms exhibit higher levels of tax avoidance prior to audits or operate under less stringent external monitoring, or when audits involve multiple tax authorities.
