Abstract

We examine whether the mandatory adoption of IFRS in 2005 increases debt covenant violations. Previous studies document a decreased use of accounting covenants after this mandatory IFRS adoption, and this decrease is attributed to either increased transparency or reduced contractibility. Our study focuses on covenant violation changes and provides more evidence regarding IFRS adoption in debt markets. Using new private debt issuances during 2001–2010 from 12 IFRS countries (Treatment Group) and 11 non-IFRS countries (Control Group), we find that debt covenant violations increase after IFRS adoption in 2005, and this increase is more pronounced in countries with high government effectiveness and high regulatory quality. These results provide new evidence to support the view of reduced contractibility following IFRS adoption.

Keywords: IFRS Adoption, Debt Covenant Violation, International Evidence
