Abstract

This study explores the role of Digital Rights Management (DRM) systems in mergers and acquisitions (M&A), focusing on their impact during due diligence. While DRM is widely recognized for intellectual property protection, its influence on governance and information asymmetry in M&A transactions has been underexplored. Using agency theory, we examine DRM’s role in reducing risks of information leakage and enhancing decision-making. Our findings show that DRM positively influences financial and legal due diligence, enhancing performance indicators such as return on assets and the thoroughness of legal assessments. However, DRM also negatively impacts business and high-tech performance, especially in patent M&A, by limiting technological flexibility and innovation. This suggests that while DRM strengthens data security, it may hinder the use of patented technologies, particularly in patent-related M&A transactions. These insights underscore DRM’s dual role in enhancing security and governance while posing challenges for technological flexibility, with important implications for M&A practitioners and policymakers.

Keywords: Mergers and acquisitions; due diligence; digital Right Management; digital M&A; intellectual Property, Due Diligence in M&A, Digital Rights Management (DRM), Information Asymmetry, Intellectual Property Protection
