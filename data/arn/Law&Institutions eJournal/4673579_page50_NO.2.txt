The Brexit Effect on German Firms

Abstract

Brexit probably reduced UK firm performance. But how did Brexit effect firms in trading partner countries? I use unique ifo surveys on German manufacturing firm's Brexit expectations, uncertainty, and performance, which allow a difference-in-differences identification of the Brexit effects on firm uncertainty and qualitative performance measures like perceived inventory adequacy and lack of orders and materials. I find little evidence for a negative impact of Brexit on German manufacturing firms. The withdrawal of individual countries from international trade and supply chains does not have to have adverse effects on trading partners.

Keywords: Brexit, Trade, Firm performance, Uncertainty

JEL Classification: D02, D22, D24
