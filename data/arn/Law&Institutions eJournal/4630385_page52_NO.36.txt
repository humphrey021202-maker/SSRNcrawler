Abstract

This paper examines the gendered effect of financial pressures on employee compensation, focusing on managers’ pressure to meet earnings expectations. Using UK subsidiary-level data from 2017–2021, I find that the gender bonus gap increases by 4.23 percentage points in firms just meeting analyst forecasts, compared to those missing or comfortably beating expectations, even after controlling for job roles. To strengthen causal inference, I exploit an exogenous decline in analyst coverage following the MiFID II reform and confirm my results in a triple-differences design. Drawing on Tilly’s (1998) theory, I submit that managers may disproportionally reduce bonuses for women to achieve earnings targets when institutional constraints are weak. Consistent with this view, the effect is only observed in firms with weaker reputational (poor ESG ratings), organizational (fewer than three female directors), and regulatory (no prior labor violations) constraints.

Keywords: Gender Pay Gap, Earnings Management, Financial Pressure, ESG
