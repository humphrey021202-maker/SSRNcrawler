Abstract

We examine whether access to firm executives at investor conferences enables institutional investors to identify future potential takeover targets. We find that in the year preceding takeover announcements, institutional investors are significant net buyers in targets that have participated in conferences, while they are marginal net sellers in other targets. Additionally, investors are more likely to increase their stock ownership when targets attend more conferences, larger conferences, and conferences hosted by experienced brokers. We also document a larger net buying activity around the conference days for firms that receive an acquisition bid after the conference relative to other conference firms that do not engage in merger and acquisition activity. Finally, targets’ conferences benefit primarily large investors and have no impact on small investors’ pre-takeover trades. Collectively, the results are consistent with investor conferences endowing institutional investors with superior information about likely acquisition targets.

Keywords: Investor conferences, institutional investors, informed trading, takeover targets, mergers and acquisitions
