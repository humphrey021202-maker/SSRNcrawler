Abstract

Using a comprehensive sample, we examine global variation in the disclosure of mutual fund manager identities. 11% of mutual funds do not disclose their management teams. Anonymously managed funds underperform those with named managers and are less likely to deviate from their benchmarks. Exploiting changes in SEC disclosure regulations, performance comparisons of anonymous twin funds, and patterns of anonymous manager allocation within fund families, we find that underperformance reflects both lower effort by skilled managers who remain anonymous and the concealment of less skilled managers. Our findings highlight disclosure as a critical mechanism for aligning incentives and improving fund performance.

Keywords: Mutual Funds; Management Teams; Anonymous Managers; Performance; Obfuscation
