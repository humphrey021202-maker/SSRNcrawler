Abstract

This study explores the influence of treasury management on the performance of listed deposit money banks in Nigeria. A multiple regression model consisting of hypothesised treasury management and performance was formulated and subjected to various diagnostic and robustness tests to ascertain the Best Linear Unbiased Estimators (BLUE) in the model. Treasury management was proxied by Credit Ratio, Loan-to-Deposit Ratio (LDR), and Loan-to-Asset Ratio (LAR), while bank performance was the dependent variable. Using regression analysis on cross-sectional data from listed Nigerian DMBs, diagnostic tests including the Breusch-Pagan/Cook-Weisberg test, Hausman specification test, and Lagrange Multiplier test were conducted to validate the model choice. The pooled regression results reveal that treasury management explains approximately 48% of the variation in bank performance. Specifically, Credit Ratio and Loan to Asset Ratio exhibit positive and statistically significant effects, while Loan to Deposit Ratio shows a negative and insignificant relationship with performance. The findings imply that asset composition and effective credit allocation are critical determinants of bank profitability, whereas aggressive loan expansion relative to deposits does not guarantee improved outcomes. Comparative evidence from international studies further supports these conclusions, highlighting that profitability is more strongly associated with prudent asset-liability management and quality asset deployment than with high Loan to Deposit Ratio levels. The study concludes that sustainable performance of Nigerian DMBs is best achieved through optimizing the mix of earning assets, strengthening credit appraisal and monitoring, and maintaining robust liquidity and risk management frameworks. It recommends that both bank managers and regulators focus on enhancing asset quality and aligning treasury practices with international best standards, rather than relying on deposit-driven lending ratios as performance benchmarks.
