Abstract

We study the effects of mandated ESG reporting on greenwashing. Our setting is a regulation in the United Kingdom requiring firms to report carbon emissions, or Mandatory Carbon Reporting (MCR). Measuring greenwashing as the discrepancy between companies’ external carbon-related discussions in CSR reports and their underlying carbon performance, we find MCR leads to a decline in three types of greenwashing: excessive length, over-optimism, and vague commitments, relative to performance. MCR also curtails greenwashing in other (non-carbon) environmental disclosures, suggesting a spillover from MCR to firms’ broader ESG reporting. Drivers include higher expected reputational and regulatory risks for non-carbon issues after MCR, and a resource spillover, where the increased firm resources allocated to MCR benefit non-carbon reporting. 

Keywords: Mandatory carbon reporting, Mandated ESG reporting, Greenhouse gas emissions, Greenwashing
