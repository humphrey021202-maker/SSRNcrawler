Abstract

We investigate whether supplier investment decisions are associated with their major customer’s strategic disclosure tone. Customers are incentivized to strategically manipulate disclosure tone to attract more stakeholder investment, including that of suppliers. However, compared to other major customers’ stakeholders, suppliers usually face less information asymmetry that enables them to see through potential disclosure tone manipulation and strategically respond by altering their investments. We find that as major customer abnormal disclosure tone increases, supplier investment intensity and the likelihood of over-investment are less. Further, when major customers are financially distressed and disclose over-optimistically, suppliers investment intensity is significantly less than when the major customer is not distressed. Additionally, we find the negative relationship between major customers’ abnormal disclosure tone and suppliers’ investment intensity is weaker in the presence of customer information asymmetry. Overall, our findings suggest suppliers utilize their information advantages in the supply chain and respond to major customer’s strategic disclosures by adjusting their investments to mitigate relevant risks.

Keywords: disclosure, tone management, forward-looking statement, supply chain, investment intensity, investment efficiency
