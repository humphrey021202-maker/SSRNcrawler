Annual Report Readability and Dividend Payout Policy

Posted: 5 Nov 2018

Date Written: February 2018

Abstract

This paper examines the association between firms’ annual report readability and corporate dividend policy. Using bog index, which captures the plain English attributes of disclosures, we find that firms with lower readability pay lower dividends. This relation is more pronounced for financially constraint firms. Our results are robust to potential endogeneity concerns and alternative proxies for both annual report readability and dividend payouts.

Keywords: readability, dividend policy

JEL Classification: G32, G35
