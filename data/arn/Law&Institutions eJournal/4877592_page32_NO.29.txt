Abstract

This paper examines the association between takeover threats and ESG performance, using anti-takeover provisions (ATPs) as a gauge to measure the extent to which firms guard against hostile takeover threats. By analyzing data from 2011 to 2020 of publicly traded Korean companies, we uncover a significant negative association between the adoption of ATPs and ESG performance. Our findings suggest that a reduction in takeover threats is associated with a deterioration in ESG performance. This result aligns with the shareholder view, indicating that managers prioritize their own interests over maximizing shareholder welfare when their positions are secured by takeover protections.

Keywords: Anti-Takeover Provisions(ATPs), ESG, Takeover threats, Korean capital market
