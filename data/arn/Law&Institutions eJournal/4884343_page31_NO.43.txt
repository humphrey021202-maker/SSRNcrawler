Abstract

Financial statement manipulation to increase net income also often increases net operating assets (NOA); when NOA reach significantly larger-than-normal levels future manipulation is constrained (Kim and Oler, 2024; Barton and Simko, 2002).  We investigate a strategy available to manipulating firms when NOA grow conspicuously large:  a “big bath” where a significant portion of NOA are written off.  This has the effect of significantly decreasing net income in the bath year, generating accounting losses and significantly negative abnormal returns, but by reducing NOA a firm with a prior history of manipulation can continue manipulating net income in future years.  Prior manipulating firms are more likely to have a subsequent big bath, and prior big bath firms are more likely to subsequently manipulate.  Some firms have multiple cycles of manipulation / big baths over multiple years

Keywords: Big Bath, Financial Statement Manipulation

JEL Classification: M41
