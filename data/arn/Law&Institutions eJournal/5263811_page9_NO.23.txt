Abstract

This study conducts an extensive empirical investigation into the influence of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors on asset pricing for firms listed in the European STOXX 600 index over the period from 2003 to 2023. Utilizing an augmented Fama-French portfolio sorting framework, we systematically classify stocks into quintiles according to their aggregated ESG scores and further decompose these scores into Environmental (E), Social (S), and Governance (G) dimensions. Contrary to prior literature we identified a negative relation between high ESG based portfolio and enhanced stock returns. The findings reveal a counterintuitive pattern: firms with higher ESG scores tend to underperform in terms of portfolio returns. However, companies with moderate levels of ESG integration demonstrate superior returns relative to both high and low ESG counterparts, suggesting a non-linear relationship between ESG engagement and financial outcomes. When adjusting for risk through the Sharpe Ratio, this inverse relationship remains evident. Further analysis employing panel data econometric techniques, including fixed effects models, alongside predictive modeling approaches, reveals that firms with stronger Environmental and Social scores exhibit lower levels of systematic risk, underscoring their potential role in enhancing portfolio stability. Moreover, we extend the traditional Fama-French five-factor asset pricing model by incorporating an ESG factor as a potential sixth explanatory variable. Our empirical results indicate that the inclusion of this ESG factor significantly improves the model's explanatory power, with the social component emerging as the most influential driver of excess returns among all ESG dimensions. Overall, this study offers nuanced insights into the complex interplay between ESG considerations, asset returns, and systematic risk, contributing to a deeper understanding of the strategic role ESG factors play in contemporary European equity markets and sustainable investment practices.
