Abstract

Hiring family CEOs is often equated to trading merit for preferences. However, indirect effects from hiring family can counterbalance this direct, negative effect on firm performance. To explore this ambiguity, we estimate a dynamic model of CEO turnover where executive candidates can be found in the family, within the firm, or outside. Firms learn about the quality of all hires from firm performance and are better informed about internal candidates. While we find firms do prefer family executives, a counterfactual prohibition of family hires decreases firm prof- its, indicating that among publicly-traded US firms the indirect benefits from family preferences dominate.

Keywords: CEO Turnover, Family Firms, Firm Performance, Corporate Governance, Learning
