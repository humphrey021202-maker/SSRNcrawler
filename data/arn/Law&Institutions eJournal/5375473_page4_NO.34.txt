Abstract

Surveying AI agents provides a scalable way to elicit realistic beliefs at high frequency. We leverage this idea to examine investor disagreement about news. We endow a local large language model (Llama 3) with 216 distinct, real-world investor personas, and elicit their sentiment toward a comprehensive sample of S&P500 news headlines. LLM investor personas disagree in economically meaningful ways: political disagreement spikes around Presidential elections, income-based disagreement rises around tax cuts, and race-based disagreement increases around the George Floyd protests. Turning to market outcomes, LLM-derived disagreement correlates strongly with abnormal trading volume, and this relationship is not explained by existing high-frequency disagreement measures. LLM-based disagreement also predicts returns: a long-short strategy based on three-month trailing disagreement earns an average excess return of 20 bps per month.

Keywords: Investor Disagreement, LLMs, Beliefs, Narratives, Trading
