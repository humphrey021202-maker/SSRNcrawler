Abstract

Staff retrenchment is one the contentious legal battle an acquirer probably faces because acquired firms so often had run into financial problems and had to lay off some employees who might have been challenging employer’s decision during business combination process. Such legal exposure passes on to the acquirer once business combination has taken place. Equally, acquirers often find existing staff of acquiree to be excessive or not congruent to its strategic objectives and retrenchments are inevitable. While the Employment Act 2000 and Labour Relations Act permit retrenchment, Malawian Courts takes a tough stance on the procedures which employer must adhere to. The results of this study have shown that banks have been exposed to significant compensation for failing to follow retrenchment procedures. Acquirers in the banking sector have ended up paying huge retrenchment compensation as directed by Courts which in other instances have exceeded the consideration paid on the acquisition challenging the viability considerations.
