Abstract

This study explores whether managers would voluntarily use higher levels of Integrated Reporting (IR) as an impression management (IM) tool. IR is measured as the extent to which integrated reports conform to the guideline principles provided by the International Integrated Reporting Centre (IIRC). Using Australian data for 2015-2017, we show that the relationship between IR conformity and firm values is positive at low levels of IR but becomes negative at higher levels. At the same time, the relationship between IR conformity and bid-ask spread (a proxy for the liquidity channel) is negative at low levels of IR but becomes positive at higher levels of conformity. Additional test results on the relationship between IR and earnings management proxies show that higher IR is associated with higher earnings management (high obfuscation), thus corroborating these results. We also find that these results are stronger for financially distressed firms.

Keywords: Financial Reporting, Integrated reporting, firm value, Impression management, Obfuscation
