Abstract

We study how automation affects the role of humans in the asset management industry, analyzing three stages of their information processing: awareness, acquisition, and integration. We find that automating the retrieval of SEC filings enables human workers to broaden their research scope across more firms, thus improving information awareness. Additionally, humans increasingly concentrate on gathering soft information from sources like conference calls and contextual data, such as historical filings, reflecting enhanced information acquisition. These improvements in awareness and acquisition enable humans to more effectively integrate information into real decisions, such as trading and portfolio allocation. Furthermore, after automation, humans redirect their efforts toward portfolio firms where they likely retain an edge over machines—namely, firms with significant intangible assets, complex multi-segment operations, or long-standing investment ties. Our analysis suggests that automation amplifies the distinct value of human workers by freeing them from routine, mechanical tasks.
