Abstract

We examine the impact of co-option on ESG disclosure. Using 10,155 firm-year observations for 1,030 US firms from 2005-2019, we document a significantly negative relationship between board co-option and ESG disclosure. The effect of board co-option on ESG disclosure is stronger in firms with co-opted directors who have been in office for three years than those with recently appointed co-opted directors. Further, firms with a male-dominated board of co-option exert a larger negative impact on ESG disclosure than firms with a female-dominated board of co-option. Our results are robust across various robustness tests, including endogeneity identifications, provide new insight into the determinants of ESG disclosure.

Keywords: Board co-option, ESG disclosure, Information environment, Male-dominated boards, Female-dominated boards
