Abstract

This study examines the factors influencing financial reporting quality (FRQ) in publicly traded companies, emphasizing the roles of corporate governance, internal controls, ethical standards, and regulatory adherence. The study employs Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to examine a comprehensive model that investigates direct and indirect relationships among these principal determinants and their aggregate effect on FRQ. The study is based on agency, stakeholder, and institutional theories, offering a theoretical framework for comprehending the interplay of these factors in influencing the quality of financial reporting. The results indicate that corporate governance, specifically the board of directors' autonomy and the audit committee's efficacy, positively impacts financial reporting quality (FRQ). Moreover, strong internal controls, ethical organizational practices, and rigorous compliance with regulatory frameworks, such as IFRS or GAAP, enhance the reliability and transparency of financial reports. The study emphasizes that internal controls, ethical practices, and regulatory compliance mediate the relationship between corporate governance and financial reporting quality, suggesting that robust governance structures are inadequate without complementary mechanisms. This study enhances the literature by presenting a comprehensive model of the determinants of FRQ, highlighting the interconnectedness of corporate governance, internal controls, ethics, and compliance. The study provides actionable insights for policymakers, regulators, and organizations, emphasizing the necessity for extensive governance reforms and the advancement of ethical practices to enhance financial reporting standards. The findings indicate potential directions for future research, such as longitudinal studies and comparative analyses across various regulatory contexts.

Keywords: Financial Reporting Quality (FRQ), Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), Corporate Governance, Internal Controls, Ethical Practices, Regulatory Compliance, Financial Transparency, Accounting Quality, Governance Mechanisms, Earnings Quality
