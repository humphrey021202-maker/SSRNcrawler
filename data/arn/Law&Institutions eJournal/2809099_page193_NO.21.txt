Abstract

Interlocking directorates between competitors may raise significant anti-competitive risks, which attract little attention in comparison to that posed by other structural links, such as minority shareholdings. This article provides a systematic analysis of the ability of current legal tools of competition law, as well as of company law and corporate governance to address those anti-competitive risks, and thereby, highlights the existence of an enforcement gap in Europe.

Keywords: Competition law, Antitrust, Corporate Governance, Corporate Law, Company Law

JEL Classification: K21, K22
