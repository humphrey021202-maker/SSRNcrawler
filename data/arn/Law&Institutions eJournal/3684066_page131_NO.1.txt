Abstract

Ownership concentration is an important mechanism of corporate governance, but its effect on corporate performance is ambiguous. Based on a sample of Chinese listed banks, we find that ownership concentration is positively associated with bank profitability during the 2007-2018 period, and the association is negatively moderated by bank size. An important policy implication is that banks may build a concentrated ownership structure to enhance their profitability.

Keywords: Ownership Concentration, Bank Profitability, Bank Size

JEL Classification: G21, G28, G32
