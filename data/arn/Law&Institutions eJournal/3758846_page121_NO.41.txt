Content analysis by word counting was used to quantify the extent and level of ESG disclosures in corporate annual reporting during 2015 to 2019, while firm value was collected by the market price.

Findings – As the results, the extent and level of environmental, social, and governance disclosures were 309.91, 1196.12, and 1197.84 average words. The most common ESG disclosure was governance disclosure following by social and environmental disclosures. Moreover, the study found the positive influence of environmental and social disclosures on firm value, while there was a negative influence of governance disclosure on firm value.
