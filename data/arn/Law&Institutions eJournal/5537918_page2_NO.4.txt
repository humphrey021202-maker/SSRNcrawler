Abstract

While intended to make up for more than a decade of underfunding, the Inflation Reduction Act raises serious concerns regarding the use of nearly $80 billion in fresh funding it provides to the Internal Revenue Service (Service). In reacting to core concerns raised regarding tax administration responsibilities, this article discusses the contemporary United States tax collection system and provides analysis and policy recommendations regarding the desired distribution of tax administration responsibilities between the government and the private sector.

Keywords: tax, tax policy, U.S. tax administration, Tax compliance, Tax collection system, Tax preparers, IRS funding, Tax enforcement, Paid tax preparers
