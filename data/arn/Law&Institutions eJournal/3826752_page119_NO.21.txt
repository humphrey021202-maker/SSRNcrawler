Abstract

This study empirically examines the effect of firm specific and macroeconomic factors on dividend
payout decision of the Ethiopian private commercial banks. Using panel data on eight private banks
covering 2008 – 2016, the random-effect regression model results revealed that liquidity, bank size
and inflation have positive and statistically significant impacts on dividend payout decision. But,
the regression results suggest that bank’s growth and investment opportunity have negative and
statistically significant impact on dividend payout decision in Ethiopian private banks.

Keywords: dividend payout, panel data, private bank, macroeconomic factors.
