Abstract

I examine the theoretical prediction that executive inside debt results in higher recoveries in bankruptcy. Using a sample of bankrupt firms, I find that supplemental executive retirement plans are positively associated with recoveries to unsecured debt in bankruptcy. Firms where CEOs have inside debt at the sample mean experience $0.053 greater recoveries per dollar of debt in the event of bankruptcy relative to firms where the CEO does not have inside debt. Consistent with theory, I also document that inside debt is positively related to efforts to preserve liquidity as bankruptcy approaches (e.g., cuts to R&D expenditures).

Keywords: Inside Debt, Bankruptcy, Pensions, Deferred Compensation, Executive Compensation
