Abstract

Newly appointed audit committee (AC) chairs face a steep learning curve. Corporate governance experts suggest that prior service on the firm’s AC should improve AC monitoring performance but their fresh perspectives, expertise, or firm onboarding policies could allow AC chairs without prior AC service to be effective monitors. We investigate whether prior AC service impacts the monitoring performance of new AC chairs. We find that financial statement misstatements are less likely when new AC chairs have prior AC service, but AC chair industry expertise can attenuate this monitoring difference in some cases. In contrast, AC chair accounting expertise, supervisory expertise, or prior experience as an AC chair at a different firm do not compensate for a lack of prior service on the firm’s AC. These findings underscore the importance of AC chair succession planning for high quality financial reporting outcomes.

Keywords: audit committee chair, audit committee oversight, monitoring, financial reporting quality, financial statement misstatements, succession, independence, firm-specific knowledge

JEL Classification: M40, M41
