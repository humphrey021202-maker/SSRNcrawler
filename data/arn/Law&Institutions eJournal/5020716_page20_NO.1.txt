Abstract

Purpose: This study examines the influence of independent directors on the financial performance of 153 listed companies on NGX, with a specific focus on the mediating role of CEO tenure. The aim is to determine whether the presence of independent directors can enhance financial outcomes and how CEO tenure mediates this relationship. Methodology: The research employs a quantitative approach, utilizing a sample of publicly listed companies across multiple industries. Data is collected over ten years (2014-2023) and analyzed using panel regression modeling to test the direct impact of independent directors on financial performance and the mediating effect of CEO tenure. Findings: The results indicate that independent directors positively influence financial performance, but this effect is significantly mediated by CEO tenure. Specifically, companies with longer-tenured CEOs benefit more from independent directors in terms of financial performance, suggesting that CEO experience and stability play a critical role in maximizing the value of independent oversight. Practical Implications: The findings suggest that companies should consider both the composition of their boards and the tenure of their CEOs when seeking to enhance financial performance. Firms may benefit from aligning their board structures with the experience levels of their CEOs to optimize governance and financial outcomes. Policy Implications: Policymakers and regulatory bodies should encourage the inclusion of independent directors on corporate boards, especially in firms with long-tenured CEOs. This could improve corporate governance standards and, in turn, financial performance, contributing to broader economic stability. Originality: This study contributes to the existing literature by exploring the nuanced role of CEO tenure as a mediator in the relationship between independent directors and financial performance, offering new insights into corporate governance dynamics.
