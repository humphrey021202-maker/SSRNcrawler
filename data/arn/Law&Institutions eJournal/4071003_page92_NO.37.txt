Abstract

This study examines the relation between penalties for violations of non-financial regulations and accounting restatements. Using a broad database of corporate misconduct in the United States and coarsened exact matching to match penalty firm-years with otherwise similar non-penalty firm-years, I find positive associations between the presence and magnitude of non-financial regulatory penalties and current and future accounting restatements. My results suggest penalties for non-financial misconduct are an important leading indicator for accounting restatements and can help stakeholders identify as yet undetected financial reporting problems. As such, regulatory bodies may consider increased information-sharing across agencies to exploit synergies in monitoring activities.

Keywords: Corporate Misconduct, Regulatory Penalties, Accounting Restatements

JEL Classification: M40, M41, M48
