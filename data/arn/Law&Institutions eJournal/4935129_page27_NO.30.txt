Abstract

This study examines the influence of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) practices on tax litigation among Brazilian companies listed on B3 from 2018 to 2022. Employing a linear regression model with panel data from 400 observations across 80 companies, the research explores how distinct ESG dimensions affect the likelihood of tax disputes. The findings reveal that robust environmental practices significantly reduce tax litigation, supporting the hypothesis that the environmental pillar (E) can effectively mitigate tax risks. Conversely, the social dimension (S) exhibits a positive relationship with tax litigation, suggesting that stronger social initiatives may increase exposure to tax conflicts, potentially due to heightened regulatory scrutiny. Corporate governance (G) practices, however, showed no significant impact on tax litigation. Additionally, the study highlights that larger and more profitable companies encounter greater tax challenges, while better current liquidity is linked to reduced tax disputes. These insights underscore the strategic importance of integrating environmental practices into corporate policies to minimize tax risks, while advising caution in the implementation of social policies without thorough tax planning.

Keywords: Tax litigation, ESG practices, Tax risks, Environmental responsibility, Corporate governance
