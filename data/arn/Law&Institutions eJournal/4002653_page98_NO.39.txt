Abstract

This paper explores the relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR) ratings and equity investment alpha. It is important to understand this relationship to determine whether CSR ratings can add value to investors. This evaluation’s finding indicate that many CSR/ESG themed passive ETFs fail to generate positive alpha by controlling for Fama-French five factors. Furthermore, the evaluation constructs and compares two equally-weighted portfolios, one consisting of the top 10 CSR-rated companies in 2013 and the other the bottom 10. Neither portfolio generates no statistically significant alpha when controlling for these factors. In addition, this evaluation tested the relationship between CSR ratings and a firm’s profitability ratio (as represented by the net profit margin), in order to further examine the impact of CSR ratings. Results indicate there is no significant relationship between a firm’s CSR rating and its profitability. This finding reveals that equity investment strategies focused solely on CSR ratings do not increase investors’ returns. Overall, this research paper provides a second opinion for investors interested in incorporating CSR rating into their investment screening procedures.

Keywords: corporate social responsibility rating, profitability, alpha, Fama-French
