Abstract

This study examines how financial whistleblowing incentives combining rewards for accurate and penalties for inaccurate accusations influence employees’ internal whistleblowing, contingent on the presence of detective controls. Potential whistleblowers face a mixed-motive dilemma, weighing self-interested concerns (e.g., retaliation, costs) against pro-organizational motives (e.g., exposing misreporting). Drawing on social norm theory, we hypothesize that rewards increase whistleblowing even if costs are only partially offset. Second, we predict that adding penalties decreases whistleblowing more strongly when other detective controls (e.g., systematic audits) are absent than present, as these controls reinforce social norms to blow the whistle. Using a repeated-interaction experiment, we find that rewards increase whistleblowing only among individuals with low honesty values. Penalties reduce whistleblowing without detective controls but not when they are present, especially for those with low honesty values. We offer practical insights for designing whistleblowing programs that align incentives with both the organizational context and individual characteristics.

Keywords: Detective controls, Financial whistleblowing incentives, Internal employee whistleblowing, Mixed motives, Social norms
