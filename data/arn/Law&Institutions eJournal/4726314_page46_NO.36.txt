Abstract

Based on the staggered difference-in-difference model, this paper uses Chinese listed firms between 2009 and 2020 to investigate the impact of green bond issuance on corporate ESG performance. We document a significantly positive relationship between the issuance of non-labeled green bonds and corporate ESG performance. We provide evidence that green bond issuance positively enhances corporate ESG performance through promoting green innovation, increasing employment opportunities and improving corporate governance. This relationship is more pronounced in non-SOEs and enterprise with higher financial constraints.

Keywords: Green Bond Issuance, corporate ESG performance, green innovation, Employment opportunities, corporate governance
