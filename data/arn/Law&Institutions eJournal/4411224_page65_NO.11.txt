Abstract

Using a hand-coded dataset tracking the backgrounds of U.S. governors, we find that military governors are less likely to increase corporate subsidies when they become “lame ducks” (i.e., ineligible to run for another term). This difference between military and other officeholders is weaker for Republican governors and stronger for governors who likely volunteered for military service rather than being drafted. We find that military governors are less likely to favor companies with the same political affiliation during their lame duck phase. Given the exogenous constitutional variation in term limits between states and governors, these effects are credibly causal.
