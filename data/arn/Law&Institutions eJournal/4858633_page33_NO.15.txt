Abstract

This paper investigates the relationship between relative performance evaluation (RPE) in CEO compensation contracts and corporate tax avoidance. Using compensation data from US firms between 1998-2020, we find that firms adopting RPE have significantly higher levels of tax avoidance. This positive association is robust to endogeneity concerns and holds primarily for firms with strong internal governance. Additional tests suggest RPE adoption incentivizes greater risk-taking by CEOs and better aligns their interests with shareholders, motivating increased corporate tax avoidance. Cross-sectional analyses reveal the association is driven by specific RPE design elements that exacerbate tournament incentives, reduce reputational costs, and enhance interest alignment. Formal mediation analysis shows interest alignment has a larger effect than reputational concerns in explaining the RPE-tax avoidance relationship. Our findings highlight the important role of RPE in shaping corporate tax planning strategies.

Keywords: executive compensation, corporate tax avoidance, corporate governance, risk-taking, relative performance evaluation
