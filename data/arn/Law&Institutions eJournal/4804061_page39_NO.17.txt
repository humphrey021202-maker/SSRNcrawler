Abstract

Based on stakeholder and agency theories, this research explores the relationship between sustainability disclosure by firms and their dividend payouts in emerging economies. Various measures like likelihood of paying dividends, stability of dividend disbursed, dividend payout ratio, and dividend yield are employed to test the research hypotheses. The findings demonstrate that higher ESG scores are associated with a greater likelihood of making dividend payments, higher dividend payments, ensuring the stability of these payments and delivering higher implied shareholder returns through dividend yield. Importantly, these results remain robust across various sensitivity analyses. These findings hold implications for investors, managers, and policymakers.

Keywords: Sustainability, ESG, dividend, emerging markets, agency theory, stakeholder theory
