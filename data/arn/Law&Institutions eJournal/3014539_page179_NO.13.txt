Abstract

We study how cultural norms from overseas affect corporate transparency in developing economies and economies in transition. Using cultural background information on board directors, we document that corporations with directors with culture from overseas have greater corporate transparency. Specifically, we show that firms with directors with foreign cultural background have more voluntary information disclosure, more analyst coverage, more accurate earnings forecast and less earnings management. Moreover, there is a greater propensity for these firms to choose Big 4 auditors. We also find that the relationship between culture from overseas and corporate transparency are more strongly positive when the cultural norms obtained from higher transparency level countries or districts. Our findings provide evidence on how directors spread transparency culture norms which rooted in their hearts to firms in developing countries.

Keywords: Culture spreading; Transparency culture norms; Corporate transparency; Chinese context
