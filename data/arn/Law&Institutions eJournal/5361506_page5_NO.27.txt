Abstract

This study explores the critical barriers that hinder the effective adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in emerging economies and examines their consequent impact on financial reporting quality. While IFRS adoption aims to enhance comparability, transparency, and investor confidence, many emerging markets face institutional, technical, and cultural constraints that obstruct full compliance. Using a mixed-methods research design, the study gathers empirical data from financial professionals, regulators, and auditors across selected emerging economies. The findings reveal that limited professional expertise, lack of adequate training, resistance from local businesses, high implementation costs, and weak enforcement frameworks are among the most significant challenges. Furthermore, the study highlights how these barriers contribute to inconsistent application of standards, reduced reliability of financial information, and hindered global comparability. The research offers practical recommendations for policymakers, regulators, and international standard-setting bodies to facilitate smoother IFRS integration and improve financial reporting outcomes in less developed institutional contexts.
