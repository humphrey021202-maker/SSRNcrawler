Abstract

This study explores an important yet under-researched issue: how does home-region focus enable Early Internationalizing Firms (EIFs) in the international post-entry phase to achieve superior international performance? Drawing upon the dynamic capabilities perspective, we attempt to address this issue and shed light on the mediating role of International Opportunity-pursuing Orientation (IOO) that translates home-region focus into international performance. Our findings from a large-scale sample of Chinese EIFs in 2017 and 2018 demonstrate that home-region focus has a positive relationship with international performance through existing IOO, but a negative relationship with international performance through envisaged IOO. Based on the findings, we discuss the contributions to the regionalization hypothesis, dynamic capabilities perspective and international entrepreneurship perspective.

Keywords: Early Internationalizing Firms, home-region focus, opportunity-pursuing, international performance, international entrepreneurial orientation
