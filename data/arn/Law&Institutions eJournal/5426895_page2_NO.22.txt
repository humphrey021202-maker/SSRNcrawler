Abstract

The increasing reliance on digital tax systems in emerging economies has positioned Nigeria's Integrated Tax Administration System (ITAS), particularly the TaxPro-Max platform, as a strategic tool for improving tax compliance and enhancing the sustainability of small and mediumsized enterprises (SMEs). This study evaluates the effectiveness of ITAS in reducing compliance costs, improving voluntary compliance, and fostering SME financial sustainability in Nigeria. A mixed-method research design was employed, combining quantitative data from 400 registered SMEs with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) and qualitative insights from in-depth interviews with Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) officials. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, correlation, regression, and thematic analysis. Findings reveal that ITAS adoption significantly reduces compliance costs and administrative burdens, which positively influence voluntary compliance among SMEs. Furthermore, voluntary compliance mediates the relationship between ITAS adoption and SME financial sustainability, thereby strengthening SMEs' growth potential, profitability, and long-term survival. However, challenges such as poor internet infrastructure, limited digital literacy, and resistance to technological change hinder optimal system effectiveness. The study concludes that ITAS is a critical driver of sustainable tax compliance and SME resilience in Nigeria, provided its implementation challenges are addressed. It recommends targeted taxpayer sensitization, infrastructural support, and continuous system upgrades to enhance the efficiency of ITAS and the financial sustainability of SMEs.
