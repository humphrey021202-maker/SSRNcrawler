Abstract

We investigate an authentic learning approach designed to develop intercultural professional skills and work-ready accounting graduates. The learning activity simulates an international client problem requiring cross-cultural student teams from an Australian and a Middle Eastern university to collaborate. Taking a multi-stakeholder lens, we investigate students’ and accounting employers’ views on the efficacy of the learning activity. According to students, the learning activity successfully developed intercultural, team, and communication professional skills aligned with graduate attributes. Accounting employers also praised the activity for effectively developing essential professional skills required in accounting roles. However, the employers collectively emphasize that technical competencies, particularly knowledge, and application of accounting standards, are of limited importance when hiring accounting graduates.
