Abstract

A frequently voiced concern is that corporate lobbying activities, at least in part, hinder the implementation of ambitious climate policies. We quantify corporate anti- and pro-climate lobbying expenses of U.S.-listed firms and identify the largest corporate lobbyists and their motives. Firms spend on average $277k per year on anti-climate lobbying ($185k on pro-climate lobbying). Anti-climate lobbyists have more carbon-intensive business models, while pro-climate lobbyists exhibit more green innovation. Firms that spend more on anti-climate lobbying earn higher returns because of a risk channel. Our results align with the increasingly common investor view that anti-climate lobbying constitutes an investment risk.

Keywords: Corporate Lobbying, Carbon Emissions, Risks
