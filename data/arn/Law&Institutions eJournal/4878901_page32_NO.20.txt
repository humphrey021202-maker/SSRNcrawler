Optimal Business Income Taxation In Presence of Income Reclassification

Abstract

This paper studies optimal business income taxation in a life cycle model of entrepreneurship with income reclassification opportunities. Accounting practices involving reclassification to avoid self-employment tax induce 2.5 percentage point increase in the degree of progressivity. Switching from the current U.S. statutory progressive tax, where labor income and entrepreneurial income are taxed alike, toward a separate nonlinear tax system calls for higher progressivity for entrepreneurs than for workers. The tax progressivity gapbetween the two occupations anticipates the forgone tax revenue due to the income reclassification margin. This margin reduces the progressivity gap, which is 12.5 percentage points and 20 percentage points with and without avoidance, respectively. Consequently, an occupation-based tax regime is more desirable as it induces less inefficiency and more welfare gains.

Keywords: Optimal income taxation, Reclassification, Tax avoidance, Self-employment tax, Entrepreneurship.
