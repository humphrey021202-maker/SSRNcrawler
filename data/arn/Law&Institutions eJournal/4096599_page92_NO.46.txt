Abstract

Users tend to provide misinformation, incorrect or misleading information, to online platform service providers to cope with potential privacy risks. Users may engage in misinformation, though providing incorrect data might damage the entire online platform ecosystem. This study examines the effectiveness and importance of corporate social responsibility (CSR) as a means to rehabilitate the reciprocal trust between users and online platform service providers so users will not engage in misinformation as a means to protect their privacy. A large-scale survey methodology was employed to collect and analyze data from 354 U.S. Facebook users. This study found an increased moral obligation not to provide misinformation when users perceive online platform service providers as highly engaged in CSR activities. Online platform service providers should regularly engage in CSR activities to motivate users not to provide misinformation, negatively impacting the quality of service that online platform service providers offer.

Keywords: Misinformation, Privacy lies, Privacy infringement, Moral obligation, Corporate social responsibility, Social contract theory
