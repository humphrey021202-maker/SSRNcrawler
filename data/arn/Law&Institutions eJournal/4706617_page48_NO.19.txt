Abstract

Using manually collected data on the voluntary adoption of clawback provisions by China's listed companies, this study explores the impact of clawbacks on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). The results reveal that clawbacks significantly boost CSR by mitigating managerial short-termism and fostering risk-averse behaviors. Additionally, the effect is more pronounced in non-environmentally or non-consumption-sensitive industries, and firms led by management with lower career stability or a lesser sense of responsibility. Our study represents a pioneering exploration of the beneficial effects of clawback provisions in China.

Keywords: clawback provisions, Corporate social responsibility, short-termism, risk aversion, Executive Compensation
