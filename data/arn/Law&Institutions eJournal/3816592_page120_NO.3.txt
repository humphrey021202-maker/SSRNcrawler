Abstract

This paper examines the effects of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) disclosure
on investment efficiency, using the adoption of Directive 2014/95/EU as a quasi-natural
shock on disclosure quality. We document a significant and robust reduction of underinvestment
for U.S. firms exposed to the Directive. Investment efficiency gains are strongest for firms with
ex-ante lower ESG disclosure levels, that are financially constrained, and for firms with more
entrenched managers. Underinvesting firms exposed to the shock raise more debt ex-post and
the additional debt is used to reduce underinvestment. These results suggest that non-financial
disclosure can play a role in mitigating information asymmetry in debt markets.

Keywords: Disclosure, Non-financial reporting quality, Corporate investment

JEL Classification: G14, G18, K20, G34, Q56
