Abstract

Firms that obtain assurance for their carbon accounting report on average a 9.5% higher Scope 1 carbon intensity and 13.7% higher Scope 1 absolute emissions than their peers in the first year of obtaining assurance. This might indicate that firms underestimate their emissions without assurance. Moreover, when controlling for assurance, we do not find evidence that SBTi target-setters reduce their future emissions. Instead, only the subset of firms that obtain assurance reduce their future Scope 1 emissions over our sample. The implications for portfolio managers and ESG raters are that taking reported carbon emissions at face value could lead to penalizing firms that are more serious about their carbon accounting as well as reductions. It also supports calls for mandatory assurance when carbon reporting is mandatory and when reported emissions are generally relied upon in regulation.

Keywords: Carbon Emission Targets, Carbon Accounting, Assurance

JEL Classification: Q54, Q56
