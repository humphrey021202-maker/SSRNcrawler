Abstract

Using a sample of U.S. listed firms from 2002 to 2022, we find that firms with higher climate risk exposure engage in greater accrual-based earnings management. These results are robust to addressing endogeneity concerns and a series of robustness checks. The effect is more pronounced among large firms, financially concentrated firms, and firms with higher corporate social responsibility. Following earnings manipulation, firms with higher climate risk exposure exhibit lower stock price volatility and analyst forecast dispersion, while firm value remains unchanged. Overall, our findings suggest that earnings management may serve to mislead stakeholders.

Keywords: Climate Risk, Climate Risk Exposure, Earnings Manipulation, Earnings Management
