Abstract

This chapter explores the influence of managers' beliefs and preferences on subjective judgments required in complex financial reporting decisions. There are frequently incentives to report upward-biased earnings, for example when managers focus on attracting investors, increasing their own compensation, or avoiding debt covenant violations. Conversely, there may instead be incentives to report downward-biased earnings, for example to build "cookie jar reserves" or to "take a big bath." The chapter outlines three approaches used by academic researchers to document evidence of earnings management: (1) direct estimates from restatements or SEC Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Releases, (2) the association between incentives and proxies for the effects of specific earnings management actions, and (3) discontinuities in earnings distributions around benchmarks. We conclude by emphasizing the importance of understanding these incentives when analyzing financial statements and providing real-life examples of accounting irregularities to illustrate the complexities arising from managerial incentives in financial reporting.
