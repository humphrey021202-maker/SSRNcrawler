Abstract

An increasing number of researchers and practitioners advocate for a systemic understanding of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through network analysis. Ironically, the burgeoning network-estimation literature seems neglected by this community. We provide an introduction to the most suitable estimation methods for SDG networks. Building a dataset with 87 development indicators in four countries over 20 years, we perform a comparative study. We find important differences in the estimated network topologies, as well as in synergies and trade-offs between SDGs. Finally, we provide some guidelines on the potentials and limitations of estimating SDG networks for policy advice.
