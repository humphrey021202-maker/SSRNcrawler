Abstract

We provide the first evidence on the properties of analysts’ share forecasts and their impact for EPS benchmarks. We find that analysts’ share forecasts are highly inaccurate, often underperforming simple benchmarks such as lagged shares outstanding. Despite this inaccuracy, EPS forecasts, which use these share forecasts, are more accurate than those formed combining actual share counts with street earnings forecasts. These seemingly inconsistent results call into question how some analysts are forecasting shares outstanding. We predict and find evidence supporting hypotheses that at least some analysts use share forecasts to herd EPS to the consensus, while others use them to walk down EPS. We then exploit variation in analysts forecasting the same firm-quarter, to assess implications of these strategic actions on EPS accuracy. We find that herding analysts achieve significant accuracy improvements in their EPS forecasts, while those walking down estimates do not. Finally, we show that these actions are unique to certain analysts, as these share forecasting strategies are highly persistent within analyst over time, and that herding and walk down share forecast behaviors tend to serve as substitutes rather than complements. Overall, we contribute to the literature on strategic forecasting by pinpointing a mechanism analysts use to strategically forecast and illustrate how strategic forecasting can enhance accuracy.

Keywords: sell-side analysts, share forecasts, analyst incentives
