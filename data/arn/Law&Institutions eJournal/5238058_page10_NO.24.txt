Abstract

This study introduces a novel conceptual framework, the formalization of informal institutions, and examines how it mitigates corporate greenwashing. Exploring China's city-level pilot program of social credit system reform as quasi-exogenous shocks, our analysis reveals that formalizing informal institutions can significantly curb greenwashing by activating formal oversight mechanisms in the meantime of reinforcing informal ethical norms. This effect is more pronounced for firms operate in regions with less favorable social environments, limited market reputation, lower market positions, and less stable operations. Furthermore, the social credit system reform not only curbs corporate greenwashing but also significantly increases the conservatism of financial reporting and boosts green innovation. Overall, our evidence confirms that formalizing informal institutions could be a new effective tool compared with standalone formal and informal institutions, which provide new insights for policy design and market regulation aiming at restricting corporate greenwashing and improving the allocation efficiency of green capital.
