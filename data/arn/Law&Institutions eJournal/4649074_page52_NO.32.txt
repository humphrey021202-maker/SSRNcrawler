Abstract

ABSTRACT: This study investigates the relationship between capital market opening and the related party transactions (RPT) of listed companies, exploiting a quasi-natural experiment. The results show that capital market opening effectively inhibited such transactions by increasing the information transparency of the companies and improving their operating conditions. In companies with small boards of directors and large-scale transactions, the inhibitive effects of capital market opening are more pronounced. This paper enriches the research on the consequences of capital market opening and the factors affecting RPT. It also provides a theoretical basis for further capital market opening.

Keywords: Keywords: capital market opening, Corporate Governance, quasi-natural experiment, related party transactions
