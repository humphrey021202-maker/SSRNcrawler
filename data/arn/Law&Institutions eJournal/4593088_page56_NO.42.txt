Abstract

This study examines the effect of directors’ educational background on financing innovation through corporate venture capital (CVC). A particular characteristic of corporate governance in France is directors’ educational backgrounds, as most have graduated from elitist institutions. Our study comprises all CVC operations undertaken by SBF120 companies between 2000 and 2018. We provide evidence on the role of directors who have graduated from elitist institutions in financing innovation through CVC. This work contributes to the debate on the usefulness of innovative financing tools for the French economy and highlights the role of directors’ background issued from elitist institutions in innovation activities.

Keywords: directors' educational background, elitist institutions, engineering, management, corporate venture capital, resource-based view
