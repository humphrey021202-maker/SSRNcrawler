Abstract

We examine capital market responses to CEO communication versus other executives in the Q&A sections of earnings calls. While CEO tone is more optimistic than other executives, we find significantly stronger market responses to CEO tone than to non-CEO tone or CFO tone. This result is more pronounced for firms with weaker information environments or higher information uncertainty. Relative to non-CEO communication, CEO communication also significantly increases earnings response coefficients. Additional analyses show that CEO tone has greater predictive ability for future earnings growth than does non-CEO tone, providing a rational explanation for our main results. We observe no significant return reversals or drifts associated with executive tone, suggesting investors efficiently incorporate the information in executives’ earnings call communication. Our results underscore the importance of CEO communication with investors in corporate disclosure strategies.

Keywords: Corporate Disclosure; Earnings Calls; CEO Communication; Corporate Executives.
