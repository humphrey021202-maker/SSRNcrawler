Abstract

A system such as bitcoin operates using a Proof of Work based consensus mechanism that many individuals have falsely claimed limits the ability for the system to scale. As a result, alternative proposals based on Proof of Stake are misleadingly being promoted as scaling solutions. However, it will be demonstrated that proof of stake is not a scaling solution but is rather a means of reintroducing ownership and equity control through a back door creation of a digital bearer share. In this, an equity system based on anonymous holdings is constructed that allows for digital control of a corporate entity outside of the provisions of regulatory controls.

Keywords: Decentralisation, proof of stake, equity, Howey test
