Abstract

We study the market reaction to events leading up to and including the release of the SEC’s Proposed Mandatory Climate Risk Disclosures in firms’ financial statements. Our goal is to evaluate whether investors benefit from this proposal. We find the market, on average, does not react to these events significantly in a short window. In the cross-section, we find a significant negative market reaction for non-CO2-reporting firms and muted reaction for CO2-reporting firms. Within CO2-reporting firms, we find no measurable difference between those with assurance and those without. We conclude there is little evidence for climate-related disclosure demand. Results also suggest significant variation in costs and benefits across firms. Thus, one overarching disclosure requirement is likely inefficient.

Keywords: ESG; Regulation

JEL Classification: G14, G21, G24, G28
