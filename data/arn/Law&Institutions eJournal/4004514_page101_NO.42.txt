Abstract

This study examines the interplay between two major global trends – the growing role of foreign institutional investors (FIIs) due to financial liberalization and the embracement of corporate social responsibility (CSR) as an investment ethos. We choose the setting of China, the world’s second-largest economy that has recently experienced substantial growth in foreign portfolio investment and increased its commitment to CSR. We find that CSR performance significantly influences portfolio allocation decisions of certain types of FIIs. Firms with higher foreign institutional ownership make better (i.e., value-enhancing) CSR decisions. This finding is robust to endogeneity checks, including quasi-natural experiments and instrumental variable estimation, and is stronger for non-state-owned enterprises, firms with higher customer awareness, and firms with more foreign directors. Monitoring and advising are two channels through which FIIs enhance the CSR-value relation. Finally, we document that FIIs enhance firms’ ability to harness the power of CSR as a driver of innovation.

Keywords: Foreign Institutional Investors; Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR); Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG); Firm Performance; Innovation; China
