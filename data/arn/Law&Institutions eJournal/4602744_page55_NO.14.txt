Abstract

I study whether and how analysts’ focus on artificial intelligence (AI), impacts AI investments by managers in non-IT firms. Using machine learning techniques to measure analysts’ focus on AI in earnings conference calls, I find that this focus is associated with greater corporate demand for AI-skilled workers in the following year, and this result is robust to a difference-in-difference and instrumental variable analysis. Analysts’ focus on AI also has a more pronounced effect on future AI demand, when analysts possess greater technology and industry knowledge on AI. Moreover, I find that analysts’ focus on AI attracts investor support for AI investments. Greater analyst focus on AI is associated with upward target price revisions, and these revisions are associated with increases in future AI demand and firm valuations. Overall, my findings highlight the information intermediation role that analysts play in AI transformation.

Keywords: Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Analysts, Managerial Learning
