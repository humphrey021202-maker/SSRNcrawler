Abstract

This chapter examines the accounting treatment of football players, focusing specifically on their recognition as intangible assets in financial statements under IAS 38. Using Juventus Football Club's 2023/24 annual report as a case study, it distinguishes between internally developed and externally acquired players. It explains why self-developed players generally do not appear on the balance sheet due to difficulties in reliably measuring development costs. In contrast, players acquired through transfers are recognized and amortized over the duration of their contracts. The chapter also explores impairment considerations and provides examples of players like Federico Chiesa, Fabio Miretti, and Paul Pogba. Furthermore, it outlines how the sale of players generates capital gains or losses and touches on the limitations of using market value for accounting purposes. This work contributes to the ongoing debate over the valuation of human capital in football and the transparency of financial reporting within the industry.

Keywords: Football players, intangible assets, registration rights
