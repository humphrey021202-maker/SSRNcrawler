Abstract

This paper develops a formal model in which corporate managers engage in non-GAAP expenditures-including ESG and DEI-because such investments are instrumental in maximizing expected firm returns under political constraints. Applying a dynamic common agency framework, the analysis shows how firms seeking political favor internalize the preferences of politicians, who themselves assign weight to societal welfare due to electoral incentives. As a result, corporate behavior reflects a derivative representation of public utility, mediated through the politician's utility function. 

At equilibrium, firms select a bundle of societal and private contributions that equate the marginal return to each, weighted by the politician's corruption index and the relative cost to the firm. This endogenizes social welfare in the firm's optimization problem and provides a utilitytheoretic rationale for CSR expenditures. The model thus formalizes how lobbying-like mechanisms can yield socially beneficial outcomes, and under certain conditions, ESG spending emerges as a derivative of the CSR preferences adopted by government.
