Abstract

Loyalty shares, which are mechanisms designed to encourage long-term share ownership through disproportional voting rights, face questions regarding their benefits and costs. We examine these questions through a natural experiment—the passage of the Florange Act in France—that required firms to adopt loyalty shares unless shareholders voted to opt out. We find differences in market reactions: negative for firms opting out and positive for those newly adopting the shares. Providing comparative evidence across these firms and across the two-thirds of French firms that previously issued loyalty shares, we show how the benefits and costs of loyalty shares vary across firms.

Keywords: Loyalty shares, one share-one vote, dual-class stock, long-term shareholders, blockholders, multiple voting rights, corporate governance, monitoring, R&D expenses

JEL Classification: G32, G34
