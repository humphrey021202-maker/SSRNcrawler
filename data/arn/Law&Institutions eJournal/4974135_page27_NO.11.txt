Abstract

We find evidence that directors’ favorable assessment of CEO ability, identified through their option exercise activity, is based on private information and accurately reflects future firm performance. As such, when directors are optimistic the likelihood of forced CEO turnover is lower and forced CEO turnover is less sensitive to firm stock performance. Likewise, following periods of poor performance, firms with an optimistic board perform better than other firms. These results hold following two exogenous market-wide negative shocks to firm performance. Finally, optimistic directors’ trade-level profitability is higher. These findings indicate that investors should pay attention to directors’ option exercise behavior.

Keywords: Director Optimism, forced CEO turnover, relative performance evaluation, insider trade level profitability
