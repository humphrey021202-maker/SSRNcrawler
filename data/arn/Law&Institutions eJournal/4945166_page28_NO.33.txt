Abstract

This study examines the impact of overseas customer social capital (CSC) on the corporate social responsibility (CSR) performance among U.S. offshore-selling firms. We find firms selling to countries with significantly higher levels of CSC exhibit stronger CSR performance, particularly in environmental and community-oriented activities. This positive impact is more pronounced among B2B firms, those facing greater regulatory exposure, and companies operating in carbon-intensive industries. These results suggest that firms strategically seek legitimacy vis-à-vis their business customers through engaging in socially responsible activities.

Keywords: Corporate social responsibility, Legitimacy, Offshore sales, Social capital, Trust.
