Abstract

This study investigates whether US public firms can achieve better Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) ratings by considering and adopting blockchain technology. Utilizing a firmlevel measure to capture management interest in adopting blockchain technologies, we find that firms with blockchain exposure exhibit an average increase of around three points in their ESG ratings. Cross-sectional tests indicate a positive association between blockchain exposure and ESG ratings is more pronounced for firms with lower energy consumption, non-toxic production, and more opaque information environments. Additionally, firms with real blockchain adoption receive higher ESG ratings than speculative (i.e., just considering the technology) and non-disclosure firms. The results remain robust when using exogenous shocks to firms’ blockchain adoption or increased market interest on blockchain technologies. Overall, the findings suggest that disruptive technologies, such as blockchain, can positively affect firms’ sustainability landscape by enhancing supply chain transparency and mitigating information inefficiencies.

Keywords: Blockchain exposure, blockchain adoption, environmental rating

JEL Classification: G30, O33, Q56
