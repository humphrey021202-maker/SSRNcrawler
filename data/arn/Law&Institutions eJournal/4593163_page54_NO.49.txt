Abstract

Using an international sample of firms, we study whether corporate sustainability influences a company’s cost of equity and whether Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) incorporate such an impact in their credit risk assessments. We show that higher sustainability performance reduces the cost of equity, but CRAs do not incorporate such risk reduction into their credit risk assessments. This result also holds after decomposing the sustainability rating into its single dimensions (environmental, social, and governance). Our results can help guide policies focusing on rating agencies as a potential tool to address sustainability concerns.

Keywords: Credit rating, ESG rating, Firm risk, Cost of equity

JEL Classification: G14, G31, K22, L21, M14
