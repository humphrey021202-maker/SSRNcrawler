Abstract

Discretion-based banking regulations assume that bank managers behave rationally. This paper challenges this assumption by showing how bank managerial sentiment affects loan loss provisions. Using large-language models on bank disclosures, we extract sentiment indicators unexplained by bank fundamentals, macroeconomic factors, or other agents' sentiment. Banks with more negative sentiment increase loan loss provisions beyond what fundamentals justify and subsequently reduce lending. These effects intensify during recessions, potentially amplifying procyclical lending patterns. Results hold using instrumental variables from sporting event outcomes. Our findings suggest that managerial beliefs inside financial institutions can shape the effectiveness of discretion-based financial regulations.

Keywords: bank sentiment, loan loss provision, procyclicality in banking, large language model, textual analysis
