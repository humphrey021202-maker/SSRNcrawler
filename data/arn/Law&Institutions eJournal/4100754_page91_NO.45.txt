Abstract

We examine whether foreign national directors (FNDs) on U.S. corporate boards help their firms mitigate the adverse effects of economic policy uncertainty (EPU) shocks originating from the directors’ home countries. Using a comprehensive dataset of U.S. manufacturing firms’ international supply chain relationships from 2003 to 2019, we find that EPU spikes in supplier countries lead to significant declines in aggregate U.S. imports as well as buyer firms’ inventory purchases, sales, and market valuation. However, firms with FNDs from the affected countries are better able to mitigate these negative impacts. Cross-sectional analyses reveal that the beneficial role of FNDs is more pronounced in firms with limited operational slack, greater difficulty accessing information about supplier countries, and higher financial constraints. Robust to a battery of sensitivity tests, our findings underscore the importance of FNDs on corporate boards during times of increased global uncertainty, especially for firms heavily reliant on foreign suppliers, and inform the debate on board diversity and supply chain resilience amid economic policy-driven uncertainties.

Keywords: foreign nationals, corporate boards, economic policy uncertainty, supply chain disruptions
