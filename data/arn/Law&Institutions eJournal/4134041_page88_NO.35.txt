Abstract

Purpose: This study examines the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) 200 listed firms that reported underlying profits from 2009 to 2012 to determine whether the underlying profits reflect accounting-based and market-based financial reporting quality.

Design: The panel-data modelling results show no relationship between underlying profits and financial reporting quality.

Findings: The study finds that underlying profits positively relate to earnings management, suggesting that firms engaging in opportunistic accrual management aggressively report underlying profits.

Originality: The study contributes to the debates about the utility of underlying profits by empirically informing that underlying profits do not contain value-relevant information for investor decision-making.

Keywords: earnings informativeness; earnings management; earnings quality; underlying profits

JEL Classification: M41
