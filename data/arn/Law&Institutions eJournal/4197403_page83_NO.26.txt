Abstract

Lending relationships are prevalent in credit markets and are a potentially important driver of bank value, but little is known about the quantitative significance of this source of intangible capital. To estimate the value of these relationships, we develop a model of the lender’s decision to enforce a contractual breach of pre-determined covenant thresholds based on the tradeoff between the cost of potential relationship termination and the benefits of increased fees and reduced risk. We find that the implied value of a relationship to the lender is 11.6% of loan principal, on average, and is significantly higher for more opaque borrowers with fewer outside options. At the bank level, relationship capital is estimated to be 6.6% of total assets or 41.2% of total capital (i.e. equity capital plus relationship capital), with significant heterogeneity across banks and over time. Nearly a quarter of aggregate relationship capital was lost in the Great Recession; in contrast with equity capital, relationship capital has not recovered. Finally, we show that banks’ market-to-book ratios are positively associated with relationship capital, consistent with the market recognizing the value of the underlying relationships.

Keywords: syndicated lending, financial covenants, lending relationships, intangible capital
