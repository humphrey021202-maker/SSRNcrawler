Abstract

This Essay explores the intricate relationship between corporate governance and organizational design, advocating for a sophisticated understanding of organizational context as critical for effective board governance. By merging legal analysis with organizational science, it presents a board governance model that goes beyond the conventional shareholder value maximization versus stakeholder theories, emphasizing the board of directors' vital role within the organizational ecosystem. The study further investigates the influence of organizational science on corporate law, especially in compliance, whistleblower protection, sustainability due diligence, and sustainable finance, suggesting that integrating organizational insights could significantly improve governance efficacy. Furthermore, it delves into board duties, particularly through the lens of the In re Caremark Doctrine, arguing for expanded oversight roles for directors and officers. This expansion is seen as crucial for promoting an ethical organizational climate conducive to effective governance, where directors can better execute their fiduciary duties, ensuring the corporation's interests remain a priority. Overall, the Essay highlights the importance of ethical stewardship and oversight in board governance and accountability, offering a fresh perspective on the symbiotic relationship between the organizational background and effective governance.

Keywords: Board governance, organizational design, In re Caremark doctrine
