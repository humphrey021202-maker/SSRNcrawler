Abstract

This paper provides a brief assessment of how ethics, culture and corporate governance have evolved in banking since the financial crisis. It concludes that we need to strengthen capital ratios and equity governance in banking to improve ethics and culture, and de-emphasize liquidity regulation. It also advocates the embrace of authentic organizational higher purpose in banking as a way to foster stability and growth.

Keywords: financial crises, bank regulation, corporate governance, compensation, bank culture

JEL Classification: G3, G01, G21
