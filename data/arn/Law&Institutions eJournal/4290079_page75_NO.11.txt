Abstract

We examine the objective function of the SEC against financial misconduct by estimating a structural model of interactions between the SEC and a regulated firm. Identification exploits SOX as a shock to enforcement intensity. Four insights emerge from counterfactual analyses. First, the welfare perceived by the SEC is more sensitive to changes in marginal social costs than to changes in marginal enforcement costs. Second, the SEC’s current enforcement mitigates earnings management to a level close to the first-best scenario. Third, a “hawkish” regulator who perceives high social costs of financial misconduct would impose excessive costs on society. Lastly, removing regulatory discretion would result in higher penalties and lower welfare, with little effect on earnings management.

Keywords: Financial Misconduct, SEC, Enforcement, Regulator Discretion, Regulator Preferences, Social Costs

JEL Classification: D78, G34, H41, K42, M42, M48
