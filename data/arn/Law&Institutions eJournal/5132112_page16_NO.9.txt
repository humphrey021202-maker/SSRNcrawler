Abstract

Abstrak CSR has become a key instrument for corporate sustainability in energy and other industries. The largest energy company in Indonesia, PT Pertamina (Persero), uses CSR innovation to address sustainability issues and promote social, environmental, and economic development. This study examines how PT Pertamina's CSR innovations affect business sustainability. This qualitative document analysis study investigates sustainability reports, yearly reports, and external publications. Research shows that PT Pertamina's CSR initiatives, such as energy transition to renewable resources, technology-based waste management, and community empowerment programs, have improved sustainability. However, uneven legislation and poor infrastructure prevent their adoption. This study shows large corporations how to employ CSR strategically for long-term sustainability.

Keywords: Corporate Social Responsibility, Innovation, Sustainability, PT Pertamina, Renewable Energy
