Abstract

Using proprietary audit adjustment data from China, we develop a novel compensation loss/gain variable derived from pre-audited earnings and examine its impact on a firm's subsequent real earnings management activities and future performance. We find that the current period's compensation loss due to a downward audit adjustment leads to an increase in next year's real earnings management activities. However, a compensation gain due to an upward audit adjustment has little or no effect on future financial reporting behavior. Cross-sectional tests indicate that the downward audit adjustment effect is more pronounced for CEOs who are more sensitive to meeting/beating short term earnings benchmarks. In addition, we observe a decline in future operating performance following these observed financial reporting changes. Together, these results suggest that the financial audit, by affecting actual CEO compensation, might have an unintended consequence on the firm's subsequent real operational activities and future performance.

Keywords: Real earnings management, CEO compensation loss/gain, Financial audits. JEL classification: D4, G34, M4, M41, M42
