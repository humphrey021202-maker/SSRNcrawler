Abstract

Purpose: This study investigates the ethical dilemmas in financial reporting, focusing on the interplay between compliance, transparency, and strategic disclosure. It aims to identify trends in financial misrepresentation and their impact on investor trust.
Design/Methodology/Approach: A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining case studies, regression analysis, and chi-square tests to examine the dynamics of financial reporting ethics. The study analyzed data from 2020 to 2024 to assess changes in financial misrepresentation and selective disclosure practices.
Findings
• Financial Misrepresentation: The study found a significant increase in financial misrepresentation from 30% in 2020 to 45% in 2024, while selective disclosure rose from 25% to 40%. 
• Transparency and Investor Trust: Regression analysis revealed a strong correlation (R² = 0.99) between financial transparency and investor trust, indicating that ethical reporting enhances corporate credibility.
• Strategic Disclosure vs. Transparency: Statistical models showed that strategic disclosure, rather than full transparency, has a stronger impact on investor confidence, highlighting the complexity of balancing ethical reporting with strategic communication.
Conclusion: The study concludes that ethical financial reporting is crucial for maintaining corporate credibility and investor confidence. It recommends a balanced approach between compliance, transparency, and strategic disclosure, supported by robust regulatory and technological measures

Keywords: Financial Reporting, Ethical Dilemmas, Transparency, Strategic Disclosure, Investor Trust
