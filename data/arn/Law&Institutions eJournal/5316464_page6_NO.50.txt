Abstract

I study the impact of the U.S. Department of Justice's self-reporting policy for the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) on firm investment decisions. I find that the establishment of a policy that rewards firms for self-reporting corruption violations reduces the likelihood that FCPA-exposed acquirers engage in highrisk mergers and acquisitions. These effects are more pronounced among larger acquirers, who face relatively greater enforcement uncertainty. Consistent with the policy increasing uncertainty regarding enforcement costs, further analyses document longer due diligence periods for high-risk targets. Affected firms are also more likely to form high-risk subsidiaries and maintain exposure to high-risk countries, suggesting the policy did not raise expected enforcement costs on average, but instead increased uncertainty over those costs. Additional tests rules out alternative explanations related to enforcement by foreign jurisdictions. Taken together, my findings suggest that when self-reporting policies make significant cooperation an implicit requirement for leniency, they may heighten perceived enforcement uncertainty and, in turn, deter firms from certain risky cross-border investments.
