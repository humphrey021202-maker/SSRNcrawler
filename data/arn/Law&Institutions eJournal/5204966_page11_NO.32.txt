Abstract

We investigate how the staggered adoption of state-level greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions targets influences private lender monitoring by applying a stacked difference-indifferences design to syndicated loans issued between 2002 and 2019. We find that the adoption of these high-level climate policy frameworks reduces lenders' reliance on environmental covenants in loan agreements, suggesting that public regulatory commitments substitute for private contractual oversight. This decline in covenant use is more pronounced among borrowers subject to strong external monitoring, those operating in high-pollution industries, and firms with established banking relationships. Despite this reduction in private monitoring, we find that statelevel GHG targets appear to significantly lower firm-level emissions. Moreover, when lenders include environmental covenants, these provisions continue to further contribute to additional emissions reductions. Overall, the results suggest that climate regulation improves environmental outcomes but may also crowd out private governance mechanisms that play a complementary role. Our study highlights the importance of policy coordination that aligns regulatory efforts with private market-based oversight to strengthen corporate environmental accountability.
