Abstract

Despite the widespread use of lease financing, how lease liabilities are estimated remains a subjective matter. In particular, credit ratings are determined using leverage ratios that incorporate subjective lease liability assessments. This paper studies the impact of rating agencies' subjective lease liability assessments on corporate leasing policy. In 2015, Moody's lowered its operating lease capitalization multiples, making an incremental dollar of lease financing count less towards Moody's assessment of leverage. Moody's-rated firms increased lease contracting in response. This increase concentrates in firms where timing of lease payments is unclear, suggesting that rating agencies play an information intermediation role by making sense of ambiguous lease schedules. Agency subjective lease assessments also have spillover effects on other financing sources; ratings-induced leasing crowds out secured debt usage. These findings highlight how subjective liability assessments have real effects on corporate financial policy.

Keywords: Leasing, Credit Ratings, Capital Structure,
