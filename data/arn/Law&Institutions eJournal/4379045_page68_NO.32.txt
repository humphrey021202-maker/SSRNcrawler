Abstract

We find empirical evidence suggesting that, over time, the increased stock market participation of investors has decreased the relevance of firms' accounting information. This negative relation is apparent primarily in the short term (i.e., over two consecutive quarters), unidirectionally Granger-causal, somewhat stronger after mid-1999, driven by transient and quasi-indexing investors and obtained after controlling for time trends, several potential risk factors and various stock market and economy characteristics. Together, these findings support the hypothesis that, due to an improvement in the risk sharing among investors, the increase in their stock market participation has weakened their incentives to process accounting information.

Keywords: Stock market participation, relevance of accounting information, risk sharing, incentives to process accounting information

JEL Classification: G14, G23, G50, M41
