Abstract

This article examines the impact of share capital on companies’ performance as well as the effect of accounting information on companies’ market performance and the impact of pre-IPO information on the predictive power of companies' performance after an initial public offering (IPO). The research was conducted on a sample of IPO companies debuting on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. It shows that a large percentage of share capital in equity reduces capital flexibility but can also be a signal to improve companies' market performance. It also shows that after an IPO, the market's information efficiency diminishes, which means, among other things, that pre-IPO accounting information has a negligible impact on the companies’ market performance after the IPO.

Keywords: capital structure, share capital, signalling, face value, capital flexibility, information efficiency, company performance, IPO, WSE

JEL Classification: G14, G32, K22, M41, O16
