Abstract

We analytically study the economic consequences of the disclosure of managerial compensation contracts in a setting where two firms, by designing compensation contracts for their respective managers, compete for a new investment opportunity. Each manager is privately informed about her firm's profitability from this investment. We find that the disclosure leads to firms' emphasizing short-term stock performance in their managers' contracts. This, in turn, induces managers to signal favorable private information via myopic overinvestment, which deters their rival firms' investments and gains their own firms a competitive edge. Nonetheless, such strategic use of compensation contracts is absent when the contracts are not disclosed; under this regime, equilibrium contracts only focus on long-term outcomes. Moreover, while disclosure-mandate-induced managerial myopia erodes firm profits, it may go towards benefitting consumer and social welfare. Our theory sheds new light on the economic consequences of the Compensation Discussion and Analysis (CD&A) disclosure implemented in 2006.

Keywords: Compensation contract disclosure, CD&A disclosure, managerial myopia, coordination failure, market competition

JEL Classification: G34, L13, M12, M52
