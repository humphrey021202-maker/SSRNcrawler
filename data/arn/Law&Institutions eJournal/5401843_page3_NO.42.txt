Abstract

Passive investment like ETFs may crowd out information-producing active investors, but empirical evidence is mixed. This study examines ETF ownership's impact on firm opacity. Results show ETF ownership significantly increases opacity, indicating passive investment exacerbates information asymmetry. The mechanism involves ETF-driven liquidity attracting short-term speculators, incentivizing managers to window-dress earnings, while simultaneously crowding out long-term institutional monitors and weakening governance oversight. This effect is stronger in firms with poor governance, high existing information asymmetry, or severe agency conflicts, highlighting governance quality as a key moderator.

Keywords: ETF ownership, Firm opacity, liquidity, Crowding-out effect
