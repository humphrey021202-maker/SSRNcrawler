Abstract

This study analyzes how delisting companies' short-run and long-run stock returns are determined using a sample of Turkish companies delisted between 2010 and 2022. First, we separate delisting companies into voluntary and compulsorily delisting. The positive buy-and-hold returns of voluntarily delisted companies outweigh the negative returns of compulsorily delisted companies. As a result, delistings positively impact the overall financial market in the long term. We show that audit opinions or going-concern modifications do not affect short- and long-run returns. Long-run returns of delisting companies depend on firms’ internal liquidity and partially on firm size. 

Keywords: Independent audit reports, delisted firms, cumulative abnormal returns, buy-and-hold abnormal returns, going concern modifications, audit opinions

JEL Classification: G33, G34, M42
