Abstract

This study investigates the impact of a firm’s political risk on its customer concentration. Using firm-level political risk measures, we find that greater political risk for suppliers leads to lower customer concentration. Firms with higher default risk, higher volatility, less product differentiation, and shorter customer relationships respond more to political risk by reducing their customer concentration. We address the challenge of causal interpretation of these findings by utilizing the exogenous increases in political risk induced by the redrawing of electoral district boundaries following the 2010 U.S. Census. Overall, our empirical evidence indicates that political risk significantly impacts firms’ operational risk strategy in terms of management of customer concentration risk.

Keywords: Operational Risk, Political Risk, Customer Concentration, Supply Chain
