Abstract

This paper reviews the literature on corporate governance in extreme institutional environments, including both formal and informal institutions. We focus on three main areas of research: corporate governance in an international context, banking and corporate governance, and governance in entrepreneurship and innovation. We document some classic papers in each of these areas and explain how the papers in this special issue contribute to the development of these areas of research. We discuss recommendations for policy and practice and offer suggestions for future research.

Keywords: corporate governance, extreme institutional environments, international business, banking, entrepreneurship

JEL Classification: G30, O16
