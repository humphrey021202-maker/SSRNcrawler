Abstract

We examine the impact of the Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) proxy voting guidelines on managers’ opportunistic reporting behaviors. In February 2015, the ISS introduced a new advisory policy based on firms’ return on equity (ROE) and started to issue negative recommendations for top executive election in firms whose past average and most recent ROE are lower than 5%. Focusing on this benchmark and underperforming firms with poor ROE history, we investigate whether these firms achieve the guidelines by conducting discretionary activities. We find that managers are more likely to achieve the 5% ROE after implementing the new policy, and they do so by accrual management, reduction of discretionary expenses, and dividend payments. We provide novel evidence suggesting that accounting-based guidelines issued by a proxy voting advisor can generate managers’ incentives for opportunistic reporting and thus discretionary activities over ROE.

Keywords: Earnings management; return on equity (ROE); institutional shareholder services (ISS); proxy voting advisor

JEL Classification: G29, G30, G38, M41
