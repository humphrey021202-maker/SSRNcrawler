Abstract

Television dramas are often used as tools for political communication, shaping public opinion and citizens’ behavior. This study examines whether such influence extends to financial markets by investigating the substantial impact of a highly acclaimed, state-sanctioned Chinese anti-corruption TV drama, “In the Name of the People” (人民的名义), on stock market performance. Released unexpectedly in 2017 as the first anti-corruption TV drama after a decade-long ban on the genre, this drama broke viewership records and carried an approved anti-corruption message. Our analysis reveals a negative stock market response to the initial broadcasting of this TV drama, particularly for politically connected firms directly impacted by its content. Further analyses on stock price synchronicity and analyst forecast revisions suggest the drama’s primary role as an information channel rather than a signal of future regulatory actions. Our findings demonstrate that politically charged entertainment television can effectively shape investors’ information sets and revise their perceptions about political connections, even in an ongoing anti-corruption campaign.
