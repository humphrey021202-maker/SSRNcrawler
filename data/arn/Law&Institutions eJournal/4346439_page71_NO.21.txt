Abstract

This paper describes a dataset capturing insider trading activity at publicly traded companies. Investors and investment analysts demand this information because executives, directors and large shareholders are expected to have more intimate knowledge of their company's prospects than outsiders. Insider stock sales and purchases may reveal information about the firm's business not disclosed in financial statements. They may also convey new information predictive of stock price movements if insiders can better interpret public information about the firm. Since mid-2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission has made these insider trading reports available to the public in a structured format; however, most academic papers use proprietary commercial databases instead of regulatory filings directly. This makes replication challenging as the data manipulation and aggregation processes are opaque and historical records could be altered by the database provider over time. To overcome these limitations, the presented dataset is created from original regulatory filings; it is updated daily and includes all information reported by insiders without alteration.
