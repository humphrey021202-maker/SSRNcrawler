Abstract

Managers sometimes provide non-disclosure to investors despite their best intentions, either due to a lack of information or substantial proprietary costs. However, it is difficult for investors to distinguish these managers from those hiding negative news. This paper investigates whether managers can establish a transparent disclosure reputation to credibly communicate the absence of information, using non-answers during earnings calls as a setting. By matching granular, timestamped earnings call conversations with high-frequency trading data, we create a novel dataset that examines immediate real-time market reactions to non-answers given by managers. Additionally, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to develop a database of measures that identify strategies managers can use to build a transparent disclosure reputation. Our findings suggest that these strategies enhance managerial credibility when communicating a lack of information, underscoring the critical role of a transparent disclosure reputation in maintaining investor trust.

Keywords: Non-Disclosure, Disclosure Transparency Reputation
