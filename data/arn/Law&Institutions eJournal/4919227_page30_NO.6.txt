Abstract

Is there a multifaceted relationship between ESG and FinTech? We answered this question utilizing both traditional regression techniques and advanced machine learning methods for both developed and developing countries spanning 2013-2021. We employed series of regression techniques namely baseline regression, polynomial regression, quantile regression, and robust regression. The advance machine learning techniques, such as random forest, support vector machine (SVM), gradient boosting, and neural networks have been employed to observe the intricate linkage between ESG and FinTech. Regression analyses reveal a significant negative correlation between ESG scores and FinTech, indicating potential trade-offs between sustainability efforts and technological advancements. Advanced machine learning techniques, specifically the random forest model, outperform other methods such as SVM, gradient boosting, and neural networks, demonstrating superior predictive accuracy and explanatory power using mean standard error and R-squared metric. These findings underscore the necessity for balanced strategies that integrate technological progress with sustainability goals, providing crucial insights for practitioners and policymakers in promoting sustainable financial practices.

Keywords: Advanced Machine Learning, ESG, FinTech, Regression, Predictability
