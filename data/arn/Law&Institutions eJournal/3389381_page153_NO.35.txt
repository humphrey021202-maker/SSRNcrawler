Abstract

We study a channel through which politicians use corporate taxes to extract firm’s resources. We find that politically connected firms pay higher taxes than their non-connected counterparts. Using presidential election as an exogenous shock, we show that politicians siphon resources from firms to realize their political objectives, e.g., increasing tax revenues and gaining votes. We also find that politicians pursue more rent seeking among firms with transactional political connections. In return for over-payment of corporate taxes, these connected firms enjoy lower cost of borrowing after the election year. These results are robust to the use of different econometric estimation techniques and support the grabbing hand hypothesis of political connections.

Keywords: Political connections, Corporate taxes, Elections
