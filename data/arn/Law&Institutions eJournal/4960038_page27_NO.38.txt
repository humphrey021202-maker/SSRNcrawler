Abstract

This research investigates digital transformation in companies and the evolving role of management accountants in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region. Grounded in the diffusion of innovation theory, the study uses a two-phase mixed-methods approach. The first phase includes a quantitative survey of 259 financial managers and professional accountants from 147 industrial companies across three GCC countries, quantifying digital tool adoption and its impact on management accounting. The second phase involves qualitative semi-structured interviews with 27 respondents, providing deeper insights into the challenges, opportunities, and perceptions of digital transformation. Results show a significant positive correlation between digital transformation and enhanced management accounting practices, especially in data quality, consistency, and reporting speed. While most respondents view digitalization as an opportunity, barriers such as resistance to change, skills gaps, and financial constraints limit full-scale adoption. The study highlights a cautious approach to advanced technologies like AI and blockchain, focusing on efficiency improvements rather than transformative innovation. It emphasizes the need for leadership support, innovation culture, and targeted training. The findings offer actionable insights for GCC companies to better align management accounting with digital transformation, enhancing efficiency and strategic decision-making.

Keywords: digital transformation, corporate performance, management accountants, e-skills, diffusion of innovations theory, GCC countries
