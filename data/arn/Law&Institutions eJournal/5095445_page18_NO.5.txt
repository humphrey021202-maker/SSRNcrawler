Abstract

This study examines the relationship between board independence and financial performance in publicly traded companies, incorporating audit quality, firm leverage, and firm size as control variables. Using panel data from 153 listed firms spanning 2014 to 2023, this study employs a random effects model (REM) regression analysis to explore the effects of independent board members on financial performance metrics, specifically return on assets (ROA). Data were collected from annual reports and verified through third-party financial databases to ensure reliability. The findings reveal that board independence positively influences financial performance, with firms exhibiting higher proportions of independent directors achieving superior ROA values. Among the control variables, audit quality and firm size positively correlate with financial performance, while firm leverage shows a negative association. These results underscore the importance of independent oversight in enhancing shareholder value and mitigating agency conflicts. This study contributes to the literature by providing empirical evidence on the moderating effects of audit quality, leverage, and size on the board independence-performance nexus over a comprehensive 10-year period. The originality lies in its integration of these critical control variables and its focus on a long-term dataset from an emerging market context, offering insights for policymakers, corporate boards, and investors aiming to optimize governance structures.

Keywords: audit quality, board independence, financial performance, firm leverage, firm size
