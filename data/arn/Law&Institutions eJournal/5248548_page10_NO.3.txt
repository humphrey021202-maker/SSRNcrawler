Abstract

IPO firms have strong incentives to provide forward-looking information, yet they do not provide forecasts in their SEC filings due to litigation and regulatory risk. We search for evidence that they provide forward-looking information via an alternative path. We find that one-third of their roadshow presentations contain business model targets, i.e., estimates of long-term expense and profit margins. These targets are optimistic relative to realizations five and ten years post-IPO. Despite the inaccuracy, the market responds at and after IPO as if the targets influence market expectations. When firms provide targets, analyst forecasts have more consensus, although analyst models include more pessimistic values than the targets. Our evidence suggests market participants find firms' forward-looking information useful even when incentives to manipulate are high, which informs the debate for changes to IPO disclosure regulation. Further, we highlight business model targets as a form of forward-looking information overlooked by prior research.

Keywords: disclosure, litigation risk, manager forecast, IPO, roadshow, analysts, financial statement analysis

JEL Classification: G17, K22, M40
