Abstract

Do industries use advertising strategically when subject to the threat of political costs? Communication via advertising can help assuage public concerns, which reduces the demand for political action against an industry. Using repeated testimony at congressional hearings to identify expected political costs, we find that scrutinized industries strategically increase advertising by 132% more in the electorates of politicians that oversee hearings involving industry members, relative to other electorates. Additional analyses show a negative correlation between strategic advertising and both the demand for - and supply of - legislation against testifying firms. In sum, our findings provide novel evidence about advertising as a channel for corporate political influence.

Keywords: Information; Congress; Political Cost Hypothesis; Image Building
