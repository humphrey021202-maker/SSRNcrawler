Abstract

This study investigates the impact of local gambling norms on the readability of firms’ annual reports. Using the Bog Index to measure readability and U.S. Census lottery data to quantify gambling norms, we find that firms headquartered in regions with stronger gambling norms tend to issue less readable annual reports. This finding suggests that firms in areas characterized by lower ethical awareness are more likely to engage in riskier and morally controversial behaviors. Additionally, we find that firms operating in controversial industries (e.g., alcohol, tobacco, and gambling) and in highly competitive markets are more inclined to produce less readable annual reports. Results from a staggered difference-in-differences analysis of state-level commercial casino legalization provide further support for our findings. These results underscore the critical role of social norms in shaping the linguistic quality of financial reporting.

Keywords: Financial reporting readability, Local Gambling Norms, Ethical Awareness
