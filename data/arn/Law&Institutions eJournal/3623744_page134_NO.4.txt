Abstract

Corporate governance has been subject to significant attention in recent times. It is more like a backbone of any corporate that emphasizes its role for survival and sustainable growth in the long run. Corporate governance ensures transparency. Transparency includes the following eight concepts, namely accuracy, consistency, appropriateness, completeness, clarity, timeliness, convenience, and governance & enforcement. Out of these, Timeliness of financial reporting is one of the attributes of good corporate governance identified by the OECD and World Bank. Shareholders and other Stakeholders need information while it is fresh and with high relevance. This paper examines the timeliness of financial reporting by Indian banks. Timeliness was measured by counting the number of days that has been lapsed between year-end and the date of the auditor’s report of the concerned banks. We took 18 banks present in the bankex list of Bombay Stock Exchange as on 28th May 2009, remaining 15 Public sector (Non-bankex) banks, and 13 Private sector (Non-bankex) banks as sample and compared their reporting patterns for the financial years 2005-2008. The reliable data were drawn from PROWESS, the database of Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE).

Keywords: Corporate governance, Timeliness, Financial reporting, Indian banks
