Abstract

I examine the effect of corporate governance on tax avoidance. Specifically, I use a regression discontinuity design to analyze the effect of governance-related shareholder proposals that pass or fail by a small percentage of votes. The passage of such proposals around the 50% threshold can be viewed as random assignment of improved governance and thus cleanly identifies a causal estimate. I find that the adoption of governance proposals decreases cash effective tax rates, which suggests that improved governance increases tax avoidance. The result contributes to our understanding of the determinants of firms' effective tax rates.

Keywords: corporate governance, tax avoidance, shareholder proposal, regression discontinuity
