Abstract

This paper examines the relation between geographical dispersion and accounting misstatements in China. We hypothesize and find evidence that geographical dispersion is positively associated with accounting misstatements in subsidiary firms, due to increasing monitoring cost as dispersion increases. We also find that geographical dispersion and institutional dispersion are negatively associated with misstatements in parent firms, indicating that parent firms may value their reputation due to external exposure as dispersion increases. Further, We only focus on misstatement sample and divide misstatements into parent firm’s misstatements and subsidiary misstatements. We find that subsidiary misstatements are more likely to occur than parent firm’s misstatements as dispersion increases. Additional analysis indicates that these results are much more pronounced for SOEs, and for parent firms with error-related misstatements.

Keywords: dispersion, accounting misstatements, parent firm, subsidiary firms
