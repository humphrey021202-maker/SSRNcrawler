Abstract

While frequent readers of tax treaty texts are used to them, the OECD Model's distributive rules (Articles 6-22) give rise to misinterpretation and misapplication by employing a combination of confusing approaches to accomplish single taxation. The author analyses the existing rules and presents a blueprint for more transparent rules.
