Abstract

This paper examines how major offshore data leaks affect the investment of small private firms linked to these leaks. Matched firm-level data show that such firms had higher investment levels than their peers before the leak but cut investment afterward. The decline is stronger among low-productivity firms and those with faster capital deductions. We further document a decline in profits and tax expenses that is not explained by reductions in sales or credit supply. These findings suggest that offshore schemes are prevalent among small firms, and that transparency driven by the leaks may have raised tax avoidance costs and reduced investment.
