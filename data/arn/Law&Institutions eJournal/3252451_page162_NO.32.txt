Abstract

After decades of theoretical inquiry, a burgeoning empirical literature now debates how ownership patterns, governance choices, and executive compensation structure affect firms' competitive behavior. An often-made assumption in the debate is that relative performance evaluation (RPE) of top management compensation encourages pro-competitive behavior. This paper shows that this claim is not generally true. Whether relative performance evaluation incentivizes more or less aggressive competition depends crucially on whether performance is measured in terms of profits or in terms of profit margins.

Keywords: compensation, incentives, common ownership, competition, relative performance, antitrust
