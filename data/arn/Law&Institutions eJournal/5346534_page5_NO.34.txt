Abstract

This study investigates why firms issue bonus shares, drawing on foundational corporate finance theories, regulatory dynamics, and empirical capital market evidence. Anchored in Modigliani & Miller's dividend irrelevance proposition, the paper contrasts theoretical neutrality with real-world phenomena where bonus issues serve as potent signals of managerial confidence, tools for liquidity enhancement, and mechanisms for optimizing perceived capital structure. Using extensive data on nearly 30 prominent Indian firmsincluding Infosys, TCS, Reliance, Wipro-and 10 global benchmarks like Apple, Tesla, Amazon, and Alibaba over 2008-2024, the analysis reveals that bonus shares often fulfill multiple overlapping objectives: conserving cash while rewarding investors, maintaining optimal trading ranges to boost liquidity, creating psychological wealth effects, and strategically aligning with regulatory or tax considerations. The report also details how India's regulatory regime under the Companies Act and SEBI ICDR tightly governs bonus issuance, contrasting with more liberal frameworks in the US and UK. Empirical case studies show positive short-term price reactions and liquidity shifts, underscoring that bonus issues are rarely purely cosmetic. This research provides nuanced insights for corporate managers, investors, and policymakers, suggesting that while bonus issues do not inherently alter firm value, they shape market perceptions, shareholder sentiment, and can strategically position firms in capital markets.
