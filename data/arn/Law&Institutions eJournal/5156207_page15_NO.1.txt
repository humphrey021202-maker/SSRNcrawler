Abstract

In recent years, company filings have featured a notable rise in anti-short selling rhetoric. This paper investigates whether changes in such language help explain fluctuations in abnormal insider equity sales. Despite disclosures suggesting an artificially suppressed stock price, we estimate a 70% increase in the probability of an insider sale following the use of certain buzzwords in public company filings, a result that contrasts with established theory. These insider sales often precede significant stock price declines and correlate with future accounting restatements, suggesting potential private information and timing effects. Additionally, we provide evidence that this rhetoric influences retail investors, who engage in increased discussion and purchases of a firm's stock after it employs anti-short selling language.

Keywords: Disclosure language, insider trading, short squeezes, retail investors

JEL Classification: G14, G32, G41
