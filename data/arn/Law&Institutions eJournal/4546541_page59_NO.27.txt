Abstract

A firm’s exposure to competition is negatively associated with its ESG performance. We measure domestic competitive pressure by product market fluidity, based on product text descriptions, and find that higher fluidity is associated with lower ESG scores. Similarly, higher exposure to Chinese import competition is associated with lower ESG scores. The effect of both domestic and foreign competitive pressure on ESG performance is larger for firms in Republican areas -- where the reputational benefits of ESG are likely to be lower. Our findings suggest that firms’ incentives to invest in ESG depend on stakeholder preferences.

Keywords: competition, product market threats, ESG, sustainability, international trade

JEL Classification: D40, F18, F64, G30, M14
