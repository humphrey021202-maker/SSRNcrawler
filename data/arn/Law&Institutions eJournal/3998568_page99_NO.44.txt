Abstract

We construct fixed income portfolios for sovereign bonds and corporate bonds with sustainable insights. The climate methodology for sovereign bonds can be applied as an overlay on any benchmark and tilts towards sovereigns more prepared with the climate transition and away from those which are less prepared. The tilts reduce sovereign carbon emissions in line with the Paris Agreement. For corporate bonds, we investigate three sustainable signals that predict excess returns: ESG scores of corporations scored across various rating and sector buckets, firm carbon emission intensities, and corporate commitments that signal reduced carbon emissions.

Keywords: ESG, ESG alpha, Sustainable Alpha, Sovereign Bonds, Corporate Bonds, Paris Alignment, Net Zero, Sustainability, ESG Flows, Carbon Intensity, SBTI Commitments
