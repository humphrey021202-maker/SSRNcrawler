Abstract

We examine whether quarterly earnings guidance induces real earnings management. Quarterly guidance may cause myopia and inefficient decision-making, as managers become overly concerned with setting and beating short-term earnings targets. We focus on guidance driven by plausibly exogenous changes in analyst coverage, and extensively validate our identification strategy. Using a large sample of U.S. firms, our evidence suggest that quarterly guidance is informative and lowers myopic incentives. However, our analyses also reveal endogenous associations exist between guidance and real earnings management. In contrast with existing concerns over frequent guiders, we find that guidance appears problematic in infrequent guiders, that issue good news earnings guidance, and that operate in settings where earnings pressures are high.

Keywords: Management earnings forecasts, frequent guidance, real earnings management, short-termism

JEL Classification: G30, M41
