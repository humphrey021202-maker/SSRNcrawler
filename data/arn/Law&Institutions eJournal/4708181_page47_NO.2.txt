Abstract

Existing studies in China have developed corporate cultural evaluation systems from different perspectives and on the basis of different theories. However, fewer scholars have constructed such a system adopting the stakeholder theory, and the associated empirical results are relatively sparse as well. This study considers a variety of stakeholder groups including founders, managers, employees, shareholders, consumers, creditors, suppliers, etc., and resorts to the vast stakeholder literature for selecting a list of evaluation component indicators. We then reduce the list's dimensionality through the factor analysis method, adopt the entropy model for the assignment of weights, and determine the evaluation index system for the corporate culture among publicly-listed companies in China. Applying the system to data shows that our proposed corporate culture evaluation has the merits of systematically focusing on corporate resources and fully mobilizing stakeholders to participate in effective corporate culture creation with great enthusiasm.

Keywords: Stakeholders; publicly-listed companies; corporate culture; evaluation indicator system

JEL Classification: G3; Z1
