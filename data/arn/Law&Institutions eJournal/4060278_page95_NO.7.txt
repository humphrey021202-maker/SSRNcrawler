Abstract

We study the role of gender in corporate debt renegotiation. Using in-court reorganizations from Brazil, we find that male-led creditors are more likely to reject plans put forward by female-led debtors. Although we cannot definitively identify the underlying mechanism driving this pattern, our findings align more consistently with gender-based discrimination compared to alternative explanations. This behavior may be costly: female-led debtors deliver higher recoveries under reorganization than under liquidation, implying that rejections potentially create deadweight losses. Supporting a miscalibrated-beliefs explanation, we observe that the gender-based rejection gap narrows when male creditors have prior exposure to successful female-led businesses, pointing to a potential path for mitigation.

Keywords: distressed debt, Chapter 11, Corporate bankruptcy, corporate reorganization, gender discrimination
