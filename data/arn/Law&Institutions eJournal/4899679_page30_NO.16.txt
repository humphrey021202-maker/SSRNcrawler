Abstract

Producing and disseminating financial reporting disclosures often involves multiple parties operating under multiple regulators. For instance, in mergers and acquisitions, companies disclose potential conflicts of interest related to fairness opinions provided by investment banks. This disclosure process involves two regulators: the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which oversees companies disseminating these disclosures in public filings, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), which regulates the investment banks producing the conflict information. We exploit this dual-regulatory setting to examine how different enforcement arrangements affect disclosure quality. We find that both regulators are effective when enforcing independently. However, the impact of the dual-regulatory regime depends on which regulator provides incremental oversight. When FINRA begins enforcing transactions previously overseen only by the SEC, disclosure quality improves, as FINRA’s information production expertise enhances the SEC’s dissemination oversight. Conversely, when both regulators are present compared to FINRA alone, disclosure quality decreases, indicating FINRA delegates enforcement tasks to the SEC. Our findings highlight that the incremental regulator plays an important role in disclosure outcomes, providing insights for designing effective multi-regulator disclosure regimes and demonstrating how overlapping regulatory authority affects financial reporting quality.
