Abstract

The present study empirically investigates the impact of corporate financial risk on executive compensation stickiness using panel data from 3,414 listed A-share companies between 2010 and 2022. It also explores this influence through a moderating effect model, while considering equity concentration as one of the influencing pathways. The findings indicate that corporate financial risk has a significantly negative effect on executive compensation stickiness, and that equity concentration has a significantly positive moderating effect on this relationship. These empirical findings remain robust after conducting a series of tests. The results of this study offer valuable insights into the intricate relationship between corporate governance structure and executive incentives, and hold certain theoretical and practical significance for enhancing corporate governance and incentive mechanism design.

Keywords: corporate financial risk, executive compensation stickiness, equity concentration, moderating effects
