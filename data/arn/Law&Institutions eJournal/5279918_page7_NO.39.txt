Abstract

This study examines how the daily returns and volatilities of both top- and weak-performing companies within the S&P 500 index influenced the index's overall behavior in 2024. Leveraging daily stock data from ten representative firms, five top-performing and five weak-performing, the analysis utilizes ordinary least squares (OLS) regression to estimate their separate and combined impacts on the S&P 500's daily returns and volatility. Findings reveal that top-performing companies explain a substantially greater portion of the index’s return fluctuations (R² = 75.5%) compared to weak-performing firms (R² = 45.6%). When both groups are included, the explanatory power increases to 84.8%. Similarly, top performers account for more than 60% of the variation in volatility, whereas weak performers explain only about 14%. Among all firms, Microsoft shows the strongest influence on both return and volatility. These results highlight the asymmetric influence of extreme stock performance on broader market indices and provide implications for investor behavior, market sentiment, and portfolio strategy in the presence of performance dispersion.
