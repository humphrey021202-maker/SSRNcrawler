Abstract

We develop a forward-looking measure of corporate misconduct risk based on the portfolio holdings of ESG funds. These funds are incentivized to monitor misconduct, as they experience significant outflows following enforcement actions against portfolio companies. Our stock-level metric, prosocial overweight, captures the portfolio tilts of ESG funds relative to a synthetic benchmark of conventional active funds. Increases in prosocial overweight predict fewer future regulatory fines and lawsuits, even after controlling for public ESG ratings and news. However, they also predict lower risk adjusted returns, highlighting a trade-off for responsible investors. This predictive power reflects informed stock selection rather than shareholder engagement.

Keywords: Corporate misconduct, legal risk, ESG funds, responsible investing, investor monitoring, disclosure, private information
