Abstract

This article presents a comprehensive corporate finance analysis of ITC Limited, one of India's most diversified conglomerates with dominant operations in fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), cigarettes, packaged foods, and hospitality. Anchored in the principles of financial statement analysis and financial modeling, the study spans a 20-year financial history, with an analytical emphasis on the past decade. It benchmarks ITC's segmental performanceespecially FMCG, cigarettes, and hotels-against key industry peers, including Hindustan Unilever, Nestlé India, Britannia Industries, and Godrej Consumer Products. The analysis is structured around core corporate finance domains: valuation (DCF and multiples), risk-return trade-offs, capital structure, payout policy, mergers and acquisitions, and ESG integration. Financial statement insights are derived from DuPont analysis, segment-level profitability trends, earnings quality diagnostics, and peer-based ratio benchmarking. Advanced topics such as real options, capital budgeting efficiency, behavioral finance implications, and sustainability-adjusted financial modeling are integrated to enhance depth. Furthermore, the report includes detailed forecasting models, scenario/sensitivity analysis, and cost of capital estimations tailored to ITC's evolving business mix. Special focus is given to understanding strategic financing decisions, corporate restructuring, and dividend policy, which have shaped ITC's capital efficiency and investor appeal. Supported by extensive data from company filings, investor presentations, and financial databases, this report delivers actionable insights into ITC's financial strategy and its alignment with global best practices in corporate finance and governance. The findings are relevant for analysts, investors, policymakers, and academics examining long-term value creation in India's FMCG sector.
