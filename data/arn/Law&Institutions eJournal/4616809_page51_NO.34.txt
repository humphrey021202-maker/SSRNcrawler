Abstract

Analysts disfavor volatile income because it hurts their job performance and career prospects. We posit that career concerns motivate analysts to pressure covered firms for smooth income by leveraging their stock promotion effort. Consistent with this prediction, we find a positive relation between firm-level analyst career concerns and the extent of smoothing. We also document that more career-concerned analysts receive more career benefits from covering smooth-income firms, and their stock promotion effort is more sensitive to covered firms’ smoothing levels. Our study demonstrates a novel mechanism—stock promotion effort—through which career-concerned analysts influence firm reporting.

Keywords: Analyst career concerns, Stock promotion effort, Income smoothing, Investor recognition

JEL Classification: G24, G30, M41
