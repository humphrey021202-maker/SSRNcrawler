Abstract

Objective - The objective of this study was to investigate the factors like corporate governance, financial ratios, and political risk and their impacts on company's survival.

Findings - The research eventually proves that agency theory and Asymmetric Information theory do occur in Indonesia. With Cox Proportional Hazard model, it then proves that all two models employed: independence commissioners, leverage, operating risk, size, return on asset and control of corruption, are variables which consistently affect financial distress of the company.

Novelty - The study uses original data and gives supported suggestion for the researched issues.
