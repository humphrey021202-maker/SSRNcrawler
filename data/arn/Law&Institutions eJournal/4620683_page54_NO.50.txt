Abstract

We investigate the association between narrative disclosure tone (NDT) and bank riskiness and examine how this association is influenced by economic policy uncertainty (EPU). Using a computerized textual analysis approach to capture NDT relying on Loughran and McDonald dictionaries and based 114 banks from eight European countries between 2005 to 2022, findings show that narrative disclosure presents useful information to stakeholders. While a positive association exists between NDT and all risk measures, this association is further heightened in events of high EPU.

Keywords: Narrative disclosure, disclosure tone, bank risk, economic policy uncertainty
