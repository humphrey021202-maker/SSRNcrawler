Abstract

This study investigates the relationship between directors’ foreign experience and corporate financial statement fraud. Using a large sample of Chinese public firms during 2008-2022, we find a significant positive relationship between directors’ foreign experience and financial statement fraud. The primary results hold for a battery of supplemental tests including the propensity score matching approach, Heckman two-step analysis, instrumental variable approach, and analysis of alternative measures. Further analyses show that director overconfidence is a potential channel through which directors’ foreign experience affects financial statement fraud. The relationship between directors’ foreign experience and financial statement fraud is more pronounced when directors are non-independent. However, high-quality audits from external auditors can moderate the positive effect of directors’ foreign experience on financial statement fraud. Both foreign working and education experience matter for financial statement fraud. For both state-owned enterprises and private-owned enterprises, directors’ foreign experience can influence financial statement fraud. Overall, our findings suggest that appointing directors with foreign experience on the board has potential costs, leading to less effective monitoring of financial statement fraud.

Keywords: Board of Directors, foreign experience, financial statement fraud, director overconfidence
