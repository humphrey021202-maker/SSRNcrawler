Abstract

In this paper, we examine the impact of local environmental beliefs on corporate environmental performance. We demonstrate a negative relation between county-level pro-environmental beliefs and plant-level toxic emissions. This correlation is particularly pronounced when the firm has a larger local investor base and when the local county has more plants, more employees, and a larger population. Furthermore, we find that stronger pro-environmental local beliefs are associated with a higher likelihood of EPA inspection, a reduced probability of receiving formal enforcement actions (conditional on inspection), and a higher penalty amount in cases of formal enforcements. In addition, we observe increased judicial support and a higher volume of environmental lawsuits in regions with more pro-environmental beliefs. Finally, we show that local environmental beliefs impact internal emission redistributions within firms, thus creating arbitrage opportunities. Overall, our paper demonstrates the significant role that local environmental beliefs play in shaping corporate environmental decisions.

Keywords: Corporate environmental performance, pollution prevention, emissions, local beliefs
