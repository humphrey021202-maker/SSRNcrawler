Abstract

This study investigates zero leverage firms and their choice to pay dividends among New Zealand (NZ) listed firms for the period 2007 – 2021. Overall our findings indicate that after allowing for financial constraints limiting firm debt capacity and firm preference for financial flexibility, firm priority to pay dividends affects firm debt levels. Additional analysis shows that dividend paying firms with growth opportunities will increase short-term debt to maintain dividend payments.
