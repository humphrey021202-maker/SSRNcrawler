Abstract

In the information age, major negative events can spread quickly and affect investor perceptions and decisions. Selecting major violent crime events in China, we investigate the role of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in mitigating regional negative public sentiment. We find that the firms with better CSR performance have higher stock returns around the event day. We also find that investors react more positively for firms engaging in technical CSR activities (those targeting a firm’s primary stakeholders) than institutional CSR activities (those serving the public). Moreover, the effect is more pronounced for firms with better internal control quality and higher information transparency. Overall, this study documents a positive role of CSR in securing firm value in the face of negative public sentiment.

Keywords: Corporate social responsibility; Negative public sentiment; Market reaction; Firm value
