Abstract

This study analyzes how research and development (R&D) investment affects dividend policy for mature firms. Using a sample of Japanese manufacturing firms during the period 2001-2014, we find that mature firms that prioritize R&D investment still pay higher dividends to mitigate agency problems with investors, as opposed to young growth firms that often pay no dividends. We also find that the positive relationship between R&D investment and dividends for mature firms weakens as effective alternative governance mechanisms exist through institutional shareholder monitoring and debt discipline. Overall, this paper provides new insights to the lifecycle hypothesis of dividends.

Keywords: Dividends, Dividend lifecycle hypothesis, R&D, R&D-intensive mature firms
