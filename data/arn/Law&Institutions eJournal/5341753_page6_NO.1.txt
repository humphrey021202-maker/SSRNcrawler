Abstract

This paper examines how processing costs affect market efficiency by exploiting a unique setting where U.S.-Israel dual-listed stocks face mandatory 30-minute trading halts on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) prior to material disclosures, while trading continues uninterrupted in U.S. markets. Due to institutional frictions, many Israeli traders who face lower processing costs for these securities are effectively prevented from trading during these halts. Using intraday trade and quote data from 2007-2024 covering 2,117 trading halts across 96 dual-listed securities, we find that during TASE trading halts, U.S. markets experience significantly increased illiquidity and volatility. We document increases in effective spreads, realized spreads, and quoted spreads, along with decreased market depth and elevated return volatility. These findings suggest that the temporary removal of lower processing-cost traders delays price discovery and increases adverse selection risk, indicating that processing costs affect market efficiency even for publicly disclosed information.
