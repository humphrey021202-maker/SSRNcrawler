Abstract

We examine how corporate investment and performance respond to salary history bans (SHBs), which restrict employers’ access to applicants’ prior pay. These bans remove a signal of worker productivity, raising hiring uncertainty and anticipated labor costs. Using a staggered difference-in-differences design, we find that SHBs reduce capital and R&D investment, especially in firms reliant on skilled labor, unable to automate, or with stronger governance. However, this more cautious investment strategy reduces overinvestment. This improved capital allocation, alongside greater employee satisfaction and match quality, yields higher profitability, productivity, and firm value. Our findings reveal that labor-side information loss reshapes resource allocation.
