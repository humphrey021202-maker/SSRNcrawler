Abstract

This paper examines the impact of ESG performance on defined benefit pension management. Firms with stronger ESG profiles assume lower pension returns and allocate fewer assets to equities, limiting earnings manipulation and excessive risk-taking. A quasi-natural experiment using the 2010 BP oil spill supports a causal link. OLS estimates show that an increase in one standard deviation in ESG score reduces assumed returns by 0.12 percentage points and equity allocations by 2.15 percentage points. These findings highlight ESG’s role in fostering financial integrity in pension assumptions and mitigating agency conflicts between shareholders and pension plan participants.

Keywords: ESG, Defined Benefit Pension Plans, Pension Assumption, Earnings Management, Pension Asset Management
