Abstract

This study examines the impact of labor exposure to climate change on corporate tax avoidance. Our finding reveals that firms with greater labor exposure to climate change engage in less tax avoidance. Cross-sectional analysis further indicates that this reduction in tax avoidance is more pronounced among firms with strong corporate governance and those located in communities advocating stricter environmental policies. Moreover, our evidence identifies prosocial behavior, financial resilience, and capital deepening as key mechanisms through which LECC influences tax avoidance. These results suggest that firms facing climate change risks adapt their tax practices to align with societal expectations, thereby demonstrating a shift toward more ethical and socially responsible corporate behavior.

Keywords: tax avoidance, labor exposure to climate change, corporate governance, financial constraints, community characteristics
