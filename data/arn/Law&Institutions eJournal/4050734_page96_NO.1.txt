Abstract

Exploiting the staggered adoption of universal demand (UD) laws as a quasi-natural experiment and the difference in difference approach, we find that US firms in states that adopted UD laws reduced their green innovation output and quality relative to their counterparts. The causal relationship is more pronounced for firms which had better external governance before the adoption of UD laws. We also document that firms’ information asymmetry dramatically increases after UD laws enforcement. Overall, our study reveals the negative consequences of weakening shareholder rights on social welfare outcomes like environmental innovation productivity.

Keywords: Shareholder Litigation, Green Innovation, Climate Risk.
