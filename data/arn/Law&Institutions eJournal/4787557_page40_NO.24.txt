Abstract

In this article, the author systematically compares the concepts of "permanent establishment" (PE) with regard to direct taxation and "fixed establishment" in respect of EU VAT, and establishes similarities and differences between the two. Although both concepts serve comparable functions (namely the allocation of taxing rights between states), their definitions differ in detail, which may lead to practical difficulties.
