Abstract

in this paper I explore the corporate social responsibility (CSR) performance within the information technology sector. And research the actual relationship between CRS and one of the firm’s critical characteristics—firm’s life circle. I test my hypothesis using a multiple variables regression analysis on a sample of 24,496 observations for 2610 firms over the period 1992-2016. I find that mature firms can have better CSR performance than young firms. Old firms are capable of generating higher income and paying back debt. Therefore, they tend to have more abilities to invest money in extra area, such as CSR. And I also check the research findings by adding lagged dependent variables. Although the association between the firm age and CSR score is weaker when involving more control variables in model, my results show there is a significant positive relationship between the level of maturity and CSR contribution.

Keywords: CSR; Endogeneity; Firm’s age; Information Technology
