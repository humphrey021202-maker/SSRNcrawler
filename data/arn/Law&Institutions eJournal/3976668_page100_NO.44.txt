Abstract

Social media is proving to be a driving force in our daily lives and businesses are not spared either. Malawi’s 2020 public offerings were marred with negative social media comments prompting issuers to respond in one way or another in an effort to instil public confidence. This study has found out that efforts from the issuers were either misleading or might have violated some statutory provisions. It is recommended that issuers must refrain from reacting to social media as their securities are fully underwritten and avoid potential fines or legal exposure for misleading information.

Keywords: Social; Media; Offerings; Malawi; Legality
