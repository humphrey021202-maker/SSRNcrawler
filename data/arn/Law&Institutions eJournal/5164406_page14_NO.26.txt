Abstract

Multinational enterprises pursue transformation strategies and grow inorganically through mergers and acquisitions (M&A). Irrespective of the macroeconomic circumstances, this trend will continue. Ensuring that related integrated tax risks and opportunities are managed well is key to its success. In this article, the authors explain the increasing importance of transfer pricing in M&A transactions during the tax due diligence phase through a case study and think ahead on post-closing items to ensure a sustainable transfer pricing model towards the future.
