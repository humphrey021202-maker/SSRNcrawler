Abstract

Academic research in finance and accounting routinely controls for information intermediary recommendations (from ISS, analysts, or rating agencies) when studying investor behavior. We demonstrate that this common practice introduces significant estimation biases by controlling for variables that themselves reflect the underlying factors researchers aim to study. Using both theoretical modeling and empirical analysis of shareholder voting and bond yields, we show that this "bad controls" problem leads to Type-I and Type-II errors and substantial misestimation of economic relationships. We propose econometric solutions and tests that can detect bad controls and produce more reliable estimates of investor preferences and market behavior.

Keywords: Bad Controls, Endogenous controls, Investor Preferences, ISS, Analysts, Credit Rating Agencies.

JEL Classification: G34, G30
