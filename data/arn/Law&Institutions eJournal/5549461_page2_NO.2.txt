Abstract

This study introduces retail real estate leases—an economically significant source of financing comparable in size to debt—as a new setting where contract terms are stated in terms of accounting information, namely tenants' revenues. Specifically, we find that retail leases commonly include revenue-sharing provisions whose payments decrease in bad states, in contrast to prior contract-level studies that document either fixed payments or performance-sensitive payments that increase in bad states. We then use a large sample of lease contracts to conduct empirical tests guided by predictions from recent incomplete contracting theory. Consistent with this theory, we find that when lessor-lessee information asymmetry is low and default is costly, revenue-sharing contracts are more common and are associated with lower tenant default rates. Our findings highlight a novel contracting use of accounting information beyond debt, and provide some of the first empirical support for theory on the efficiency of revenue-sharing contracts.

Keywords: accounting information, incomplete contracting, leasing, real estate
