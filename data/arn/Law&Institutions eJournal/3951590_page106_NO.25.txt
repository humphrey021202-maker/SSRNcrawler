Abstract

I study how antitrust concerns arising from product markets inﬂuence corporate disclosure in capital markets. While securities regulators encourage disclosure, product-market regulators discourage disclosure of competitively sensitive information. Thus, ﬁrms may refrain from disclosing such information when antitrust regulators and private plaintiﬀs use corporate disclosure to infer collusion. Using peer ﬁrms’ announcements of product price increases as a shock to antitrust concerns, I ﬁnd that companies with more antitrust concerns reduce their disclosure of competitively sensitive information, such as information on future strategies, sales, production, and product markets. Additional analyses suggest that ﬁrms with more antitrust concerns may also raise their product prices without issuing explicit press releases. To avoid further attention from antitrust regulators and plaintiﬀs, these companies limit their disclosure of competitively sensitive information. Overall, my ﬁndings suggest that antitrust considerations from product markets can spill over into capital markets.

Keywords: Antitrust, Disclosure, Securities Regulation
