Abstract

This paper investigates how strong social ties affect agent-regulator relationships and financial misconduct in U.S. registered investment advisories. Using difference-in-differences to exploit the quasi-experimental properties of the Dodd-Frank Act, I find that the change in regulatory purview increases the fraudulent malpractice in mid-sized advisory firms compared to large advisories. Financial misconduct increases at advisories more socially connected to regulators, even after controlling for geographical distance. The results show a disrupting agent-regulator relationship effect when the officer belongs to the largest homogeneous group, white males, and insignificance among female and under-represented minority groups. Consequently, the change in regulators and misconduct affect advisory firms' performance and services.

Keywords: Financial Adviser, Financial Misconduct, Financial Regulation, Difference-in-differences
