Abstract

We empirically examine mutual fund exit and voice in relation to politically motivated charitable giving (PCG), i.e., donations from corporate foundations to legislator-affiliated charities. This type of corporate political spending is observable only with private effort, in contrast to mandatorily disclosed lobbying and political action committee (PAC) expenditures. Do institutional shareholders' trading and voting decisions take semi-opaque political spending into account? We find that 1) most funds increase holdings in relation to PCG despite reputation risks, while high-ES-portfolio funds decrease exposure; 2) PCG is associated with mutual fund support for shareholder proposals calling for political activity transparency, except in funds heavily invested in socially stigmatized industries. These findings are robust to controlling for other types of political spending. More importantly, in falsification tests, we do not observe similar results for non-politically-motivated charitable giving. The combined evidence suggests that not only do mutual funds monitor indirect political spending, but they also trade and vote in response with internally consistent strategies.

Keywords: mutual fund monitoring, mutual fund governance, corporate political spending, corporate political activity, ES funds, proxy voting
