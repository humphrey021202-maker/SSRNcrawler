Abstract

We investigate how operational inflexibility influences corporate tax avoidance as a strategic buffer against operational shocks. We document a positive relationship between operational inflexibility and corporate tax avoidance. Exploiting two exogenous regulatory shocks—banking deregulation, which relaxes credit constraints to a greater extent for more inflexible firms, and labor-law changes that directly restrict operational flexibility—we provide evidence that this relationship is likely causal. The effects are economically significant: for instance, following the labor-law shock, firms pay about 46% less in taxes, consistent with a substantial increase in tax avoidance. The effect is most pronounced among firms with volatile cash flows, greater financial constraints, higher institutional ownership, more independent boards, and risk-taking CEOs. These findings suggest that tax avoidance can create value for firms facing operational challenges, particularly for those with stronger governance mechanisms.

Keywords: Firm Inflexibility, Financial Flexibility, Corporate Tax Avoidance, Banking Deregulation, Value Creation, Labor Market Rigidity
