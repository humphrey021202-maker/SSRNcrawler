Abstract

In this paper I re-examine RETURN and CASH FLOW predictability. Instead of focusing solely on dividend, as one source of cash flow, I consider two other forms of cash flows; repurchase as positive and issuance as negative cash flows. The results show that while dividend yield predicts return, distribution yield, which considers all distributions, predicts future cash flows. This means that investors receive different signals from different types of cash flows. Dividend news signals both long-run and short-run prices and has no information about future cash flows. On the other hand, buyback and issuance news although signal short-term prices, they has no information about long-run prices. Instead they highly predict the future cash flows. This, in turn, implies that irrelevance of repurchases and issuance is way more believable than irrelevance of dividends.

Keywords: Dividend, Cash Flow, Buyback, Return Predictability
