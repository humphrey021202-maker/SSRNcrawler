Abstract

We study the decision of listed companies to stay or leave the Russian market amid the invasion of Ukraine, and the resulting stock market reaction. By exploring the impact of ESG and human rights scores, we find that lower scores are coupled with a greater likelihood of keeping the Russian operations unchanged. Human rights and ESG scores not only affect the decision to leave or remain, but also impact the stock market reaction following a complete exit of the Russian operations. .

Keywords: Russian invasion, ESG, Market Exit, Stock Market Reaction
