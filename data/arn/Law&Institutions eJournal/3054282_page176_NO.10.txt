Abstract

Overproduction reduces cost of goods sold by spreading fixed costs over an inflated number of units. An estimate of the overproduction bias helps predict future profitability, and adjusting profitability measures to undo this distortion improves their explanatory power for future profitability. The estimated bias also helps predict stock returns, suggesting that investors do not fully understand the impact of overproduction on reported profitability. These findings hold for LIFO firms as well as after the implementation of SFAS 151 in 2005, although the information content of the estimated overproduction bias for future profitability has significantly declined since 2005.

Keywords: overproduction, earnings quality, earnings management, EBITDA, EBIT, market efficiency, forecasting, valuation, inventory
