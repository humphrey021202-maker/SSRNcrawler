Abstract

How do labor unions influence corporate disclosure to strengthen their position in wage bargaining? We develop a theoretical model in which unions pressure firms to disclose minimal financial information while discouraging environmental transparency. We empirically test this mechanism using a regression discontinuity design based on union election outcomes and novel AI-generated disclosure measures. We find that unionization leads to a significant reduction in environmental disclosure. This effect is more pronounced when unions possess greater bargaining power or are less financially constrained, but attenuates under increased public scrutiny. Our findings shed new light on how labor unions negotiate through disclosures.
