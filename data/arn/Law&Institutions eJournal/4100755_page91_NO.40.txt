Abstract

I examine the impact of ambiguity (Knightian uncertainty) on firms’ voluntary disclosure decisions. I find that an increase in ambiguity—uncertainty over the probabilities of outcomes—is associated with less management guidance while confirming the well-known result that an increase in risk—uncertainty over outcomes—is associated with an increase in guidance. Furthermore, I provide novel empirical evidence suggesting that voluntary guidance under ambiguity has adverse capital market consequences in the form of heightened implied volatility and severe share price decline. My findings are consistent with the notion that managers consider the ambiguity in the environment, thereby demonstrating that ambiguity has an important and distinct impact on firms’ voluntary disclosure decisions.
