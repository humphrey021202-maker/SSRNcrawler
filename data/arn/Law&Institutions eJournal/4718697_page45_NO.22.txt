Abstract

Interest in sustainability information, from investors, managers, researchers, and others, has been expanding rapidly. We discuss recent advances and open questions related to sustainability reporting and disclosure through the lens of a supply and demand framework. Our discussion builds on prior research on financial reporting and highlights unique aspects of the provision of sustainability information.

Keywords: Sustainability reporting, Sustainability disclosure, ESG, CSR

JEL Classification: G38, M41, Q01
