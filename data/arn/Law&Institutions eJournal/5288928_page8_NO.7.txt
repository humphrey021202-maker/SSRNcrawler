Abstract

This study examines the multifaceted factors influencing academic success among first-year management students at Trincomalee Campus, Eastern University, Sri Lanka, focusing on the roles of Academic Self Efficacy, Technological Self Efficacy, and Prior Learning. Through a comprehensive analysis incorporating demographic profiles, survey responses, and regression modelling, the study elucidates the interplay between these variables and their impact on students' performance in accounting education. Results reveal a positive correlation between Academic self-efficacy, Technological self-efficacy, and academic success, underscoring the pivotal role of students' confidence in their academic abilities and technological proficiency. While Prior Learning also contributes to academic achievement, its influence appears comparatively weaker. These insights highlight the importance of cultivating a supportive learning environment that enhances students' confidence and proficiency in key academic and technological domains to optimize their academic outcomes in accounting education. The study contributes to the understanding of factors shaping academic success and informs targeted interventions aimed at fostering student empowerment and excellence in accounting education.

Keywords: Academic Self Efficacy, Academic Success, Accounting Education, Prior Learning, Technological Self Efficacy
