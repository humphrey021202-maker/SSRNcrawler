Abstract

Purpose-The study investigates the role of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in mediating the relationship between institutional ownership and corporate tax avoidance, with particular emphasis on the Egyptian context. Design/methodology/approach-This study uses a panel dataset of 29 Egyptian companies listed on the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) index, covering the period from 2017 to 2022. The structural equation modeling using path analysis was used to examine the direct and indirect effects of institutional ownership on tax avoidance, and how CSR mediates such relationship in ESG companies. Findings-The study finds that institutional ownership positively impacts corporate social responsibility (CSR), but its direct effect on tax avoidance is insignificant. CSR mediates the relationship between institutional ownership and corporate tax

Keywords: Egypt, Corporate social responsibility, Tax avoidance, Institutional ownership, ESG companies
