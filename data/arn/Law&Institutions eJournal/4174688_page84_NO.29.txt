Abstract

We analyze the effects of common institutional blockholders (CIBs) on corporate dividend policy and the peer effects induced by such CIBs across firms. We find that firms are more likely to pay dividends when other firms held by the same common institutional blockholder have paid dividends. To mitigate endogeneity concerns, we analyze the exogenous formation of CIB relationships across firms, finding that dividends become more correlated across firms following the exogenous formation of CIB ties between them. We also document that CIBs are more likely to penalize firms for not catering to their dividend preferences through proxy voting. 

Keywords: dividend policy, peer effects, common institutional blockholders, shareholder voting, dividend clienteles
