Abstract

Malawian banking industry has undergone seismic transformation over the past twenty years. It has been two decades of plethora of new entrants followed by acquisitions propelled by minimum paid capital requirements which have forced smaller banks to be absorbed by bigger banks. The barriers of entry into the banking industry have been enhanced which can fuel oligopolistic tendencies to the detriment of the economy but there is hope that smaller banks can thrive once community banks directives have been operationalised.

Keywords: Acquisition; Merger; Bank; Malawi; Licence
