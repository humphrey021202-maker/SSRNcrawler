Abstract

Researchers have long sought to understand how firms internally drive value. Management accounting research, in particular, has developed for decades the seminal concept of value drivers, which represent the internal financial and non-financial processes through which firms create value. However, the lack of consistent and publicly available data capturing these internal activities has constrained empirical research from broadly examining firm-level value creation. In this study, we develop new text-based measures to systematically capture firms' financial and non-financial value drivers by collecting and analyzing over 318,000 archived snapshots of public U.S. firms' website homepages (1995–2020) from the Wayback Machine. Leveraging established conceptual frameworks from accounting literature, we classify and construct standardized annual measures of firms' value drivers. Our measures exhibit meaningful variation over time and demonstrate distinct patterns both within and across industries. We validate our measures through associations with established financial and non-financial proxies. Additionally, we demonstrate their utility in both financial and managerial accounting research contexts, including applications to predicting long-term growth and analyzing executive compensation design. By offering a replicable methodology for quantifying firms' value drivers using publicly accessible historical website data, our study enables researchers to more comprehensively understand how firms internally drive value.
