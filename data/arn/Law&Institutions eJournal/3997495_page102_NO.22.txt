Abstract

We examine the real effects of the SEC's 2016 tick-size pilot on firms' M&A activities. Following the negative shock to stock liquidity, affected pilot firms reduce M&A intensity, mainly diversifying deals. These firms also lower stock payment proportions, avoid large transactions or public targets, but have higher completion rates and greater value gains, particularly for firms with less pre-pilot impaired goodwill. Partial M&A reversals occur after the completion of the pilot. Our findings suggest stock liquidity shocks lead to a firm’s reduced M&A investment intensity by eliminating low-quality deals and structuring transactions more cautiously.

Keywords: Tick size pilot, Stock liquidity, Real effect, M&A investment, Stock payment JEL Classification: G18, G34
