Abstract

Synergistic value integrates insights from the stakeholder theory the resource based view theory and shared value. The stakeholder theory provides opportunities to align business practices with societal expectations and sustainable environmental needs. Businesses ought to reconcile disparate stakeholders’ wants and needs (e.g. employees, customers, investors, government, suppliers etc.). By forging alliances with internal and external stakeholders business can create synergistic value opportunities. This may lead to an improvement in mutual trust and understanding. As a result, there are also benefits for corporate reputation, brand image, customer loyalty and investor confidence. This societal engagement also responds to third party pressures, it lowers criticisms from the public and minimises regulatory problems by anticipating legal compliance.

Keywords: Synergistic Value, Corporate Social Responsibility, Strategy, Strategic CSR, Strategic Management
