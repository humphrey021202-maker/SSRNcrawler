Abstract

This paper investigates the effect of share repurchases on corporate investment during the COVID-19 global crisis. To identify share-repurchasing firms, we leverage the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which induced a repurchase upsurge following its enactment. Using a sample of U.S. firms from 2018 to 2021, we document a general investment decline in post-pandemic years. However, such a decline appears milder for firms that repurchased shares post-TCJA compared to those that did not engage in repurchasing activity. In cross-sectional analysis, we find that share-repurchasing firms with equity incentives aligning directors’ interests with those of shareholders, classified boards and long-term investors, or low financial constraints experience even smaller investment reductions during the pandemic. Taken together, these results suggest that tax-motivated repurchases do not necessarily hinder corporate investments and challenge recent claims that repurchases deplete essential liquidity needed during periods of corporate stress.
