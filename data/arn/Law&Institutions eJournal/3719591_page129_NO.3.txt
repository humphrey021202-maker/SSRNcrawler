Abstract

Boards of directors encourage risk-averse managers to take risky actions by providing stock options and severance pay. We demonstrate that the ability of these incentives to encourage risk-taking hinges on the level of uncertainty facing the manager. We confirm prior findings that stock option convexity encourages risk-taking, but find that this relation only holds when market-wide uncertainty is low. We also confirm prior findings that severance pay encourages risk-taking, but find that this relation only holds during high market-wide uncertainty and negative market-wide performance. Finally, we find that compensation committees respond to variation in uncertainty by adjusting the level of option grants. Our results suggest that the effectiveness of incentives to take risk varies with the market-wide uncertainty and that boards consider this in annual compensation design.

Keywords: executive compensation, market uncertainty, corporate governance, executive risk-taking incentives
