Abstract

Stable public markets are the secret to private equity (PE) optimism. An NLP analysis of publicly-traded PE firms’ Q1'24 earnings call transcripts reveals a significant rebound in PE confidence over the last two years. After peaking in Q3'21, PE executives' sentiment declined in 2022 as inflation, geopolitics and fed-driven volatility ended a post-COVID calm. However, with rates finding footing, Global PMI at a 12-month high and volatility subsiding, PE sentiment in Q1'24 reflects renewed optimism. This quarter, PE executive sentiment surged to its second-highest level in 57 earnings seasons, underscoring the inverse relationship between market turbulence and PE industry morale.
