Abstract

We propose a financial statement (FS) fraud detection framework, called Peer-
Meta, that makes improvements in all three components of the detection procedure:
label measurement, feature set, and detection model. For the label measurement,
prior studies mainly adopt FS fraud events that have already been disclosed and
confirmed. We construct a new measure based on news coverage that can reflect
unrevealed FS fraud behaviors as well. For the feature set, we innovatively add
peer factors learned through the business description texts in financial reports. For
the detection model, two meta-learning algorithms are applied to aggregate the 18
popular classifiers. The results indicate that the proposed method has amazingly
high recall, reaching a staggering value of 0.98. We document that all components
in PeerMeta contribute to the improvements of FS fraud detections and also showcase
the significant economic value of the detection framework and find that recall
is more crucial for the economic value than precision.

Keywords: Financial statement fraud, News coverage, Detection framework, Peer effects, Machine learning

JEL Classification: D21, D22, D91, G32
