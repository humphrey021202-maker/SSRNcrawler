Standardizing Trust or Performing Control? Ipsas, Fraud, and the Rituals of Accountability in EU Recovery Governance

Abstract

This paper theorizes International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) as governance infrastructures that perform accountability rather than secure it. In the context of the European Union’s Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF), IPSAS - based frameworks are increasingly used to demonstrate fiscal responsibility and unlock conditional funding. We argue that these standards operate less as instruments of financial integrity and more as tools of symbolic compliance. Drawing on critical infrastructure theory and the concept of audit performativity, the paper develops a conceptual model that situates IPSAS within broader struggles over legitimacy, control, and institutional capacity. Through comparative analysis of fraud - prone RRF cases in Italy, Austria, and Greece, we show how IPSAS adoption facilitated milestone compliance while obscuring operational vulnerabilities. Our findings reveal a persistent gap between the formal structure of accrual reporting and the substantive enforcement of financial accountability. By reframing IPSAS as socio - technical artefacts embedded in asymmetric fiscal governance, this study contributes to debates on ritualized audit cultures and the limits of supranational standardization. We conclude by calling for a shift in public sector accounting reforms: from performance display to embedded accountability, grounded in audit capacity, institutional readiness, and resistance to performative control.

Keywords: IPSAS, Accountability, Conditionality, Fraud, Governance
