Abstract

This paper explores the most important determinants of dividend policy in India's developing energy sector for the period between 2013 and 2023. The research utilizes panel data regressions, primarily Pooled OLS and Fixed-Effects models, in examining how profitability (PROF), unexplained expenses (UE), cash flow (CF), liquidity (LIQ), firm age (AGE), financial leverage (LEV), and firm size (SIZE) affect dividends per share (DPS). Preliminary diagnostic tests indicated all variables were stable and not highly correlated, as expected, which validates the econometric models as being trustworthy. The pooled OLS model established profitability as having a strong predictive link for DPS and the fixed-effects model added more information by accounting for variability between businesses that do not change over time. It validated profitability's significant positive effect on DPS as would be expected from financial theory and empirical research. It also established a strong negative relationship between unexplained costs and DPS and hypothesizes higher earnings variability or inefficiency may lead to lower dividend payments. The findings of study are important for investors, policymakers, and business executives. These explain the way to achieve that fine balancing act between rewarding shareholders and satisfying the urgent investment requirements in India's changing energy situation. It's not a sinecure, however, gaining command over those drivers can make it less challenging to navigate through all the variables involved.
