Abstract

The rapid rise of cryptocurrencies, tokenized assets, and decentralized finance platforms has fundamentally challenged traditional accounting and financial reporting standards. Existing frameworks, such as IFRS and GAAP, were not designed to address the unique characteristics of digital assets, including extreme price volatility, decentralized ownership, cross-border transactions, and automated smart contract governance. These limitations have created inconsistencies in classification, recognition, valuation, disclosure, and auditing, resulting in reduced transparency and comparability for investors, regulators, and corporations. This paper proposes a comprehensive global accounting framework for digital assets that integrates blockchain-based verification, artificial intelligence-driven real-time valuation, and harmonized disclosure standards across jurisdictions. The framework categorizes digital assets into transactional, investment, and utility/governance tokens, providing tailored accounting treatment for each type.

By leveraging AI for dynamic fair value estimation and blockchain for immutable ownership verification, the model enhances accuracy, reliability, and auditability of financial statements. The framework also outlines enhanced disclosure requirements, including volatility metrics, regulatory compliance, and smart contract functionality, to improve transparency and facilitate global comparability. Through qualitative interviews with accounting professionals, quantitative simulations of cryptocurrency valuations, and stress-testing scenarios, this study demonstrates the framework’s effectiveness in addressing current reporting gaps. Adoption of this framework promises to foster investor confidence, enable standardized cross-border reporting, and support the sustainable integration of digital assets into mainstream financial markets, positioning accounting practices to meet the challenges of a rapidly evolving digital economy.
