Abstract

As financial crimes evolve, traditional fraud detection systems struggle to keep pace. This chapter explores how the latest conversational AI technologies like ChatGPT or Claude can revolutionize fraud management. Leveraging natural language processing, these AI assistants can analyze data intelligently, identify red flags, provide regulatory context, and guide investigations. The seven case studies in this chapter illustrate conversational AI's applications across anti-money laundering (AML) processes – transaction monitoring, network analysis, alert suppression, sanction screening, know-your-customer (KYC), audits, and regulatory reporting. The AI assistants can detect complex patterns, visualize criminal networks, rationalize alerts, automate filings, and enable auditors to validate AI model fairness transparently. However, responsible implementation of conversational AI in fraud management requires addressing data quality, privacy, AI bias, and model explainability challenges. Techniques like data masking, SHAP/LIME, counterfactual explanations, and fairness metrics are proposed as potential solutions. Conversational AI empowers financial institutions with cognitive capabilities to outmaneuver fraudsters continuously. Yet ethical AI principles of accountability, transparency, and fairness must be upheld for successful adoption.

Keywords: Anti-Money Laundering, Bias Mitigation, ChatGPT, Claude, Conversational AI, Data Privacy, Explainable AI, Fraud Detection
