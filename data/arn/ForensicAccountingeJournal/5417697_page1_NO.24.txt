Abstract

This book provides a comprehensive overview of accounting fundamentals, contemporary challenges, and the transformative influence of Artificial Intelligence (AI). It begins with foundational concepts such as the accounting equation, double-entry bookkeeping, and the construction of financial statements, before examining essential principles such as Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and the full disclosure policy. The discussion expands to include conservatism, revenue recognition, matching, and materiality, illustrating how these frameworks shape financial transparency and decision-making. The analysis then shifts to societal challenges, including globalization, IFRS vs. GAAP convergence, fraud, ethical accountability, technological disruption, and the struggles of small businesses. The latter sections focus on AI’s growing role in automating routine tasks, enhancing fraud detection, refining forecasts through predictive analytics, and improving auditing and compliance. Rather than replacing accountants, AI redefines them as strategic advisors and data interpreters. The conclusion emphasizes that the profession is not at risk of disappearance but of elevation, requiring new skillsets, ethical vigilance, and regulatory adaptation. By integrating the wisdom of traditional principles with the opportunities of emerging technology, accounting can remain the cornerstone of trust and strategic insight in the modern economy.
