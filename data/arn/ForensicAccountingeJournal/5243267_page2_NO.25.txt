Abstract

The case study aims to achieve the following learning objectives, structured according to the Revised Bloom’s Taxonomy: First, explore the corporate governance framework: recall the roles and responsibilities of key stakeholders at UCICI Bank and AUDIOCON Group and their coordination in governance structures; interpret the principles of stakeholder theory and their application in governance decision-making processes; apply ethical frameworks like the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics Framework and the Josephson Institute Ethical Decision-Making Model to evaluate governance effectiveness; analyse governance lapses and identify gaps in oversight and stakeholder coordination; and propose reforms in governance frameworks to prevent future fraud; evaluate how effectively the governance structure addresses corporate fraud. Second, examine the concept of conflict of interest: understand the ethical and legal implications of conflicts of interest presented in the case; apply knowledge to assess corporate governance failures related to conflict of interest; analyse oversight lapses and identify causes for governance failure; evaluate SEBI regulations on conflict of interest and recommend strategies to mitigate such conflicts in corporate settings; explore the concept of related party transactions (RPTs); understand how RPTs influence governance and stakeholder interests; apply governance principles to assess the legality of RPTs in the case; analyse risks and ethical concerns associated with RPTs and governance failures linked to these transactions; and evaluate proposed regulatory reforms to enhance oversight and transparency. Third, derive key lessons from the case: understand areas for improvement in corporate governance practices, internal reporting mechanisms and whistleblower protections; apply lessons to create strategies for improving governance practices and protecting stakeholders; analyse systemic governance flaws that contributed to the fraud; evaluate the effectiveness of governance practices in preventing similar frauds in the future; and create recommendations for improving governance, ethics and whistleblower policies. Fourth, examine basic issues and remedial measures: understand the root causes of governance failures in the case; apply knowledge of corporate governance principles to recommend reforms in regulatory and accountability frameworks; analyse weaknesses in the existing governance system that enabled fraudulent activities; evaluate the feasibility of proposed remedial measures for transparency and ethical practices; and create new governance policies to enhance accountability and prevent future frauds.
