Abstract

Both forensic accounting practitioners and valuation experts require specialized knowledge that involves obtaining professional designations from a governing body which oversees the critical requirements, rules, and regulations. However, these various professional standards are often complex, confusing, and in some instances, are in conflict.

In this article, Dean Driskell III, Brandon McFarland, and Andrew Duncan identify some of the forensic accounting and valuation industries’ more common professional organizations and their corresponding designations. They also analyze and compare the standards and where multiple standards may apply.

Keywords: Forensic Accounting, Valuation, Economics
