Abstract

As an expert witness, the forensic accountant imparts vital accounting knowledge to judges or juries who are often unfamiliar with such matters. This crucial role can influence litigation outcomes; however, little is known about forensic accountant litigation communication. To provide insight, I interview 24 experienced forensic accountants, uncovering two primary dimensions of their communication: understandability and source credibility. Additionally, while prior accounting literature emphasizes expertise and trustworthiness in establishing source credibility, I identify appeal as another critical factor. My study also explores how forensic accountants develop these dimensions, by, for example, using analogies and leaning into the accountant stereotype. Furthermore, I highlight if and how forensic accountants can repair communication failures, finding they often emphasize one communication factor to compensate for failure to develop another. My research provides a novel perspective on the accountant's role in legal proceedings, demonstrating how accounting knowledge is communicated beyond traditional business contexts. 

Keywords: forensic accounting, expert witnesses, source credibility, understandability, communication repair

Ethics Approval

I received ethics approval from my institution.
