Abstract

The interplay between capital structure choice and dividend policy has long intrigued scholars and practitioners, yet the trade-off mechanism remains inadequately explored in emerging markets. This study investigates the effect of capital structure choice on the dividend trade-off among publicly listed nonfinancial firms in Nigeria, where financial constraints, volatile markets, and agency conflicts pose significant challenges to optimal financial decision-making. The problem arises from the conflicting goals of debt servicing and shareholder payout, which complicate firms' ability to balance financing and distribution strategies effectively. The purpose of this study is to examine how firms' capital structure decisions-specifically the mix of debt and equity-affect their capacity and willingness to pay dividends, and to assess the extent to which firm-specific characteristics shape this relationship. Using a panel dataset of 127 firms listed in the Main Board of the Nigerian Exchange (NGX) from 2014 to 2023, the study employs a random effects model to control for unobserved heterogeneity and test the hypothesized relationships. Findings reveal a significant inverse relationship between leverage and dividend payout, supporting the trade-off theory: as debt levels rise, firms reduce dividends to preserve liquidity and meet debt obligations. Firm size and profitability moderate this relationship, with larger and more profitable firms displaying a weaker negative association. The study is limited by its exclusion of financial firms and reliance on secondary data, which may not fully capture managerial intent or investor expectations. However, its findings have practical implications for corporate finance managers, investors, and policymakers, emphasizing the need for balanced financing strategies that consider dividend sustainability. Socially, the study underscores the importance of transparent financial policies in building investor confidence. This research contributes original empirical evidence from a developing economy context, enriching the literature on capital structure-dividend policy nexus and informing more nuanced capital management strategies.
