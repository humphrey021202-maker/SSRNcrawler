Abstract

Ethical decision-making is central to the study of professional accounting practice. When a professional accountant engages in decision-making without consideration of ethics, decision quality may decline, and stakeholders may suffer severe financial implications. Situational factors such as the length of time available for deliberating decisions may influence the accountant’s ability to make a sound ethical decision.  The result of compromised ethical decision making is an increased potential for fraudulent behavior.   Recent disruptive trends in professional accounting, such as workforce reduction and automated technologies, may alter the time for decision-making. Together, these trends result in a change in workload and a new variation in decision time.  However, despite these substantial changes to the work situation, financial stakeholders continue to demand sound ethical decision making. This analysis synthesizes peer-reviewed articles exploring how decision time impacts ethical decision quality and identifies a need for workload optimization in professional accounting.
