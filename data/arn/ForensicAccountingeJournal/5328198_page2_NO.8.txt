Abstract

The burgeoning digital economy presents profound challenges to traditional international taxation systems. This paper scrutinizes the evolution of digital global taxation frameworks and their implications for India. Highlighting initiatives like the OECD' 1 s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project, particularly the two-pillar solution, the research delves into India's proactive measures, including its digital services tax (DST). The study evaluates the economic, legal, and administrative consequences of these developments, offering a comprehensive analysis of how India is adapting its tax policies to address the digital economy's complexities and to assert its position in the global tax reform landscape. The rapid digitization of the global economy has led to significant challenges in the realm of international taxation. Traditional tax systems, designed for a brick-and-mortar economy, struggle to address the complexities introduced by digital business models. This research paper explores the transformation of digital global taxation and its implications for India. It delves into the evolving international tax framework, including the OECD's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) initiative and the Inclusive Framework on BEPS, focusing on the two-pillar approach. The paper examines India's response to these global changes, the introduction of its digital services tax, and the potential economic, legal, and administrative implications.

Keywords: Digital taxation, India, OECD, BEPS, global tax reform, digital services tax, international cooperation, revenue implications, administrative challenges, legal implications, tax base strengthening, global minimum tax
