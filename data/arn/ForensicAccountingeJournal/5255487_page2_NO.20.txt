Abstract

This research paper examines the role and efficacy of forensic accounting in financial crime investigations, emphasizing its importance in identifying and mitigating various forms of financial fraud, such as money laundering, embezzlement, and financial statement manipulation. This study employs a mixed-method approach, integrating qualitative interviews with forensic accountants and quantitative survey data, to investigate the techniques and tools utilized in forensic accounting and the challenges encountered by professionals in the discipline. The results demonstrate that although forensic accounting methods are proficient in detecting financial crimes, significant deficiencies exist in the available tools, alongside challenges including jurisdictional obstacles and elevated investigation expenses. This research enhances the comprehension of forensic accounting practices and provides recommendations for enhancing fraud detection techniques and regulatory structures. It also proposes directions for future research, specifically in examining the potential of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and blockchain to improve forensic accounting investigations.

Keywords: Forensic Accounting, Financial Crime, Fraud Detection, Financial Fraud, Investigative Techniques
