Abstract

Regulators claim IFRS flexibility complicates violation detection, while practitioners believe detailed GAAP rules better mitigate compliance risk. We add to this discussion by leveraging South Korea's 2011 IFRS mandate---a shift from rules-based K-GAAP to principles-based IFRS---using a proprietary 2003-2018 financial reporting oversight dataset, including records of non-violating firms. Our entropy-balanced comparison indicates that IFRS enforcement significantly boosts misstatement detection propensity, share price discounts, and perceived earnings quality declines of misreporting firms versus K-GAAP. These findings suggest that IFRS adoption leads to higher enforcement costs by enhancing regulators' capability to prove misstatements and scienter, contributing to global debates on IFRS enforceability and informing U.S. policy discussions on principles-based securities regulation in the post-Sarbanes-Oxley era.

Keywords: enforcement cost; IFRS; legalism; principles-based standards; rules-based standards; substance over form

JEL Classification: K22; G11; G14; M41; M42; M48
