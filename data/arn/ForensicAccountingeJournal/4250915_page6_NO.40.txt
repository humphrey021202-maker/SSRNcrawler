Abstract

China’s stock exchanges launched regulated, interactive investor platforms in 2010 and 2013 to empower retail investors. Investor-initiated interactive communications on these platforms are negatively associated with the propensity of corporate misconduct. The identified effect is associated with the information asymmetry channel, but not with various potential confounding factors. The interactive investor platforms serve as important monitors of corporate misconduct, which could be adopted by other regulatory jurisdictions.

Keywords: Corporate misconduct; Investor-initiated interactive platforms; Quasi-social media; Sentiment; Value effects

JEL Classification: D83, G15, G34, G39, O30
