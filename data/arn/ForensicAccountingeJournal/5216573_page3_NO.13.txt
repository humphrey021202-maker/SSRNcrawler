Abstract

Institutional ownership has emerged as a critical corporate governance mechanism influencing firm performance, yet empirical findings remain inconclusive. This study examines the effect of institutional ownership on the financial performance of publicly traded firms, addressing gaps in the literature regarding its effectiveness in monitoring managerial decisions. The study employs a panel data regression approach, utilizing financial data from 150 publicly traded firms in Nigeria over 10 years (2014-2023). A random effects model (REM) is applied to account for firm-specific heterogeneity while controlling for key firm-level characteristics. The findings indicate a positive and significant relationship between institutional ownership and firm performance, measured by return on assets (ROA). This suggests that institutional investors play a vital role in enhancing corporate governance by mitigating agency problems and promoting long-term value creation. The study's implications are twofold: first, policymakers and regulators should consider strengthening institutional investors' role in governance frameworks to enhance corporate accountability. Second, corporate managers should recognize institutional investors as strategic partners that can influence firm performance positively. Despite its contributions, the study has certain limitations. It focuses on publicly traded firms, potentially limiting generalizability to private firms. Additionally, the study does not differentiate between different types of institutional investors, which may have varying monitoring capabilities and investment horizons. This research contributes to the literature by providing empirical evidence on the governance role of institutional investors, particularly in emerging markets. By highlighting the significance of institutional ownership in firm performance, this study offers valuable insights for scholars, investors, and policymakers seeking to improve corporate governance mechanisms.
