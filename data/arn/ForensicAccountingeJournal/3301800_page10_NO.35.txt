Abstract

We assess the impact of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) on real earnings management (REM) activities before CEO turnovers. Improved corporate governance post-SOX can either mitigate the horizon problem (the deterrence effect) or pressure CEOs to inflate earnings when facing imminent turnover risks (the pressure effect). We find evidence for a strong pressure effect. Post-SOX firms with departing CEOs record higher levels of REM measures. In addition, such increases in upward REM activities are more pronounced in poor-performing firms.

Keywords: CEO Turnover, SOX, Real Earnings Management, Horizon Problem

JEL Classification: C23, G30, M41
