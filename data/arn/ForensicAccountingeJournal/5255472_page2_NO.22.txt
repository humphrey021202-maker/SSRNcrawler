Abstract

Corporate fraud presents a substantial threat to financial stability, requiring effective systems for detection and prevention. This study analyzes the efficacy of forensic accounting and whistleblower initiatives in enhancing corporate accountability while addressing the obstacles that impede implementation. A mixed-method approach was employed to collect data via a survey of 200 professionals from diverse sectors, including banking, healthcare, manufacturing, government, and technology. The results indicate that forensic accounting is predominantly viewed as an efficacious instrument for fraud detection, with 75% of participants rating it as "very effective" or "moderately effective." The study identifies significant challenges encountered by whistleblower programs, such as fear of retaliation (42.5%), insufficient legal protection (25%), and inadequate reporting mechanisms (15%).

Notwithstanding these challenges, 80% of participants advocate for increased investment in forensic accounting technologies and enhanced whistleblower protections. The research advocates for advancing forensic auditing technologies, fortifying legal frameworks for whistleblower protection, and cultivating a corporate culture characterized by ethical transparency. Future research ought to investigate the amalgamation of artificial intelligence, blockchain technology, and predictive analytics within forensic accounting, in addition to the effects of regulatory reforms on whistleblower engagement. Enhancing forensic accounting and whistleblower initiatives is crucial for maintaining corporate integrity, fostering investor confidence, and ensuring long-term financial stability.

Keywords: Forensic Accounting, Whistleblower Programs, Corporate Fraud, Financial Transparency, Fraud Prevention, Corporate Governance, Ethical Reporting
