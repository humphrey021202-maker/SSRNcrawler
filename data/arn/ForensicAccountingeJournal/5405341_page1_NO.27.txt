Abstract

We investigate whether audit firms propagate reputational shocks triggered by financial fraud across their client networks. Our finding is that issuers experience significantly higher bond issuance costs following fraud detection at other clients sharing the same audit firm. These reputational spillovers intensify when audit firms have weaker reputations or issued modified audit opinions to fraudulent clients, and are further magnified for issuers characterized by greater information uncertainty, weaker corporate governance, or domiciled in regions with more rigorous legal enforcement. Additionally, spillovers escalate with fraud severity, sanction intensity, frequency, duration, and detection timeliness. Affected issuers respond by issuing bonds more frequently and shortening debt maturities. Overall, our results emphasize the importance of audit-firm-related reputational spillovers in bond market pricing.

Keywords: Audit Firms, Financial Frauds, Reputational Spillover, Credit Spreads
