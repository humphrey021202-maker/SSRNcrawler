Abstract

There is a growing interest among investors, customers, employees, and other stakeholders in assessing a firm's non-financial performance, including environmental and social outcomes. This study advocates examining firms' non-financial violations as an approach to assess firms' nonfinancial performance. The article sheds light on the prevalence of non-financial violations, possible reasons for their prevalence, and potential strategies for regulators, stakeholders, and firms to enhance compliance with non-financial regulations and thus non-financial performance.

Keywords: corporate misconduct, compliance, non-financial violations, non-financial performance JEL Classifications: M40, M41
