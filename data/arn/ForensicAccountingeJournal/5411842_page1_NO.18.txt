Abstract

This paper introduces AI GAAP™, a sovereign artificial intelligence framework for real-time accounting standards, compliance monitoring, and financial transparency. While global accounting practices are governed by GAAP and IFRS, enforcement remains fragmented, retrospective, and vulnerable to manipulation. AI GAAP™ provides governments, regulators, and corporations with continuous oversight powered by anomaly detection, sovereignty-by-design architecture, and immutable audit trails. The framework aims to reduce systemic risk, rebuild trust in financial reporting, and ensure compliance becomes an instrument of fiscal strength rather than a reactive burden.
