Abstract

This paper updates a prior two-part paper published in August 2021 analyzing what appears to be one of the largest corporate tax frauds in the history of the United States. Since around 2003 to the present Apple Inc. has shifted an estimated half-trillion dollars or more of what appears to be mostly U.S. source pretax income into various nontaxable foreign shell or otherwise low-substance affiliates. Several weeks after Apple testified at a U.S. Senate hearing in May 2013 the European Commission launched an investigation that concluded in August 2016 that Apple had evaded billions in both U.S. and Irish taxes between 2003 and 2014. The European Commission ordered Apple to pay approximately €14 billion to Ireland for “state aid” and after a lengthy appeals process the judgement was upheld by the European Court of Justice in September 2024. Because the underlying income was determined to be largely U.S. source pretax income Ireland maintained a provision allowing the taxes to be paid to the IRS  provided the IRS sought to collect these taxes. The IRS has never moved to collect these taxes, nor to prosecute what appears to be a violation of a U.S. tax law that became effective in 2009 that also required Apple to prepare a key document under oath evidencing compliance with that law. Apple promptly violated the regulation and later submitted the false document to the IRS and a U.S. Senate committee, which appeared to hide the violation from detection. This paper documents how Apple’s U.S. tax returns would then have deliberately and falsely misrepresented its U.S. source income as foreign source income, and how company executives made a false statement to a U.S. Senate committee, and how Apple included a false statement in its SEC filings for several years indicating that its billions in profits reported in Ireland were “generated by subsidiaries organized in Ireland” when these profits were generated in the U.S. and taxable there as U.S. source income under the 2009 periodic adjustment regulations, and possibly other regulations such as effectively connected income, economic substance, and other regulations, statutes and judicial doctrines. The paper estimates that Apple currently owes the IRS as much as $200 billion in taxes, penalties and interest for its violations of the 2009 periodic adjustment law, which is part of the estimated $1 trillion in similar violations industry wide, of which Apple is estimated to be the largest. The paper notes how the IRS LB&I division has historically never enforced the 2009 periodic adjustment law and likewise has rarely referred companies such as Apple Inc. for investigation by the Criminal Investigation division, when the facts require such a referral according to its audit manual.
