Abstract

Purpose – This study aims to investigate the evolving and pivotal role of accounting professionals in guiding multinational companies toward substantive compliance with recent extraterritorial laws, specifically those aiming to address human rights violations and corruption.

Design/methodology/approach – This study examines recent laws affecting multinational companies alongside relevant research in accounting and law, as well as reports, company disclosures and other documents.

Findings – Emerging extraterritorial laws create meaningful opportunities for accounting professionals to expand their roles in financial reporting, auditing, disclosure and internal control. By applying their expertise and embracing broader responsibilities, accountants are uniquely positioned to contribute to the effectiveness of these laws by helping organisations mitigate regulatory risks.

Social implications – Extraterritorial laws offer new avenues for accountants to leverage and expand their roles in combating corruption, protecting human rights and advancing ethical business practices on a global scale.

Originality/value – This study offers a novel perspective on addressing complex cross-border challenges by linking the evolving global regulatory landscape with the expanding role of the accounting profession.

Keywords: Human rights, Corruption, International business, ESG, Modern slavery, Extraterritoriality
