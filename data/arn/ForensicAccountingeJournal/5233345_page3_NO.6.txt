Abstract

The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has brought profound transformations to the field of financial auditing, reshaping traditional practices and introducing innovative tools that enhance precision, efficiency, and risk management. This research article delves into the evolving role of AI in modern audit functions, focusing on the application of advanced technologies such as machine learning, natural language processing, and robotic process automation. Through a comprehensive analysis of current academic literature, industry practices, and expert opinions, the study examines the practical implications of AI in auditing, including its impact on data analysis, fraud detection, and audit quality. The abstract further highlights the emerging benefits of AI-such as real-time auditing, scalability, and improved accuracy-while also addressing pressing challenges related to data quality, ethical considerations, and the shifting role of auditors in an increasingly automated environment. By synthesizing theoretical perspectives with real-world insights, this article provides a forward-looking exploration of how AI is shaping the future of financial auditing and the regulatory frameworks that must evolve in response.
