Abstract

This article investigates the impact of accounting fraud by Kanebo and the resulting penalties on Kanebo and its auditor, ChuoAoyama, on the stock prices of clients of ChuoAoyama and the other Big 4 auditors in Japan. Studying the case of a low-litigation country provides us an opportunity to test whether reputation loss of auditors matters without an insurance rationale. We find that the announcements of poor audit quality decreased the stock prices of clients of both ChuoAoyama significantly and the other Big 4 auditors to a lesser extent. Such industry-wide spillover has not been examined using a low-litigation setting in previous studies.

Keywords: audit quality, auditor reputation, monitoring, spillover, event study

JEL Classification: M4
