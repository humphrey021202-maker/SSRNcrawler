Abstract

This study investigates the significance of forensic auditing in identifying fraud and maintaining compliance in Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) reporting. This framework is becoming increasingly essential for corporate accountability and sustainable investment. This investigation adopts a qualitative approach, incorporating semi-structured interviews, case studies, and document analysis to explore the intricate ways forensic auditors identify ESG-related fraud, including greenwashing and social compliance misreporting. Significant findings reveal that forensic auditing methods-especially data analytics, blockchain tracking, and document verification-effectively detect fraud and improve ESG claims' transparency. Nonetheless, obstacles remain, such as the absence of uniform ESG metrics, varying regulatory frameworks, and restricted data availability, which hinder the auditors' ability to validate ESG disclosures. The investigation underscores the significance of forensic auditing as a distinct investigative method that enhances conventional audits by providing a more thorough examination essential for precise ESG reporting. It suggests that companies integrate forensic auditing into their ESG practices and that lawmakers establish uniform regulations to enhance effective ESG oversight. The results improve comprehension of how forensic auditing can strengthen ESG accountability, offering essential insights for organizations, regulators, and stakeholders dedicated to promoting a more transparent and sustainable corporate environment.

Keywords: Forensic Auditing, ESG, Fraud Detection, Greenwashing
