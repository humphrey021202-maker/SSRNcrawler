Abstract

Economic standards, norms and regulations can possess weak spots that might be exploitable for the embezzlement of an organization’s assets with resultant material consequences in money laundering, tax evasion, fraud, corruption, and other potential financial crimes

Our methodological approach is to introduce and discuss a new logical-deductive test that we name as ‘embezzler test’. Our test investigates regulatory architectures from the perspective of someone attempting to divert assets from or to an organization. It appraises whether a potential embezzler could divert resources without being detected and sanctioned.

The embezzler test can be applied to a broad range of standards, norms and regulations.

This new can be improved and further calibrated in future research.

Researchers, regulators, and law makers can use the new test to identify, and eventually fix weak spots for embezzlement in norms, standards and regulations.

To our knowledge, such a test has never been formulated or applied before to identify weak spots for potential embezzlement in regulatory architectures.

Keywords: embezzler test, embezzlement, economic regulations, accounting, norms, standards, fraud, tax evasion, money laundering
