Abstract

In this study, we use environmental fines as a proxy for corporate environmental irresponsibility and demonstrate that a simple machine learning approach can predict environmental irresponsibility with notable accuracy. Our parsimonious model generally outperforms both bootstrapped and financial statement-based benchmarks. Consistent with the view that firms may engage in corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities for legitimacy purposes, we find that most of the significant predictors of environmental irresponsibility are the firm’s CSR actions, and that more CSR actions are associated with an increased likelihood of future environmental irresponsibility. We illustrate how our machine learning approach can be useful for lenders and investors. Overall, our results suggest that 1) having CSR actions should not be conflated with achieving good environmental outcomes; 2) the prediction of environmental irresponsibility, especially at the extensive margin, should not rely solely on financial statement variables; and 3) machine learning predictions of environmental irresponsibility can help mitigate downside risk.
