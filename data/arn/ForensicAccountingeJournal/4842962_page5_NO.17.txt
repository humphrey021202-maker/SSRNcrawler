Abstract

Financial statement fraud is a significant concern in today's world, representing the most financially destructive form of occupational fraud. It negatively impacts a wide array of stakeholders, including the organization itself, its investors, creditors, suppliers, employees, and the general public. Given its critical importance, this issue has been a focal point of scholarly research over the past decades. Previous studies have utilized a diverse array of statistical, machine learning, and deep learning techniques to analyze both arithmetic and textual data. However, the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for detecting financial statement fraud remains largely unexplored. Recent scholarly work underscores the potential of LLMs in various linguistic analyses and auditing tasks. In this study, we examine the ability of an LLM, specifically ChatGPT-4, to identify fraudulent financial statements by analyzing text segments extracted from annual reports. We focus particularly on the CEO’s letters to shareholders and sections discussing the company’s risk exposures. Rather than employing complex fine-tuning, we utilize prompt engineering techniques, that can be easily implemented by auditors without machine learning expertise. The findings are promising, demonstrating the potential of LLMs to uncover financial statement falsifications. By incorporating human feedback into the model’s classification results, we achieved a performance score of 67% across sensitivity, specificity, and F-Measure metrics. With the ongoing growth in model size and capabilities, coupled with active research in prompt engineering, we anticipate further improvements in performance shortly. This research could prove invaluable to auditors, lenders, investors, and regulatory bodies.
