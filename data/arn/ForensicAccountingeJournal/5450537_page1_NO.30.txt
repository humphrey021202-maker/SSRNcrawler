Abstract

Anomaly detection is critical in economy, accounting and financial studies. In this paper, we use a hybrid of linear and machine learning models, and combine results based on respective model’s inverse root mean square error (RMSE) weights to predict expected audit fees in Chinese listed companies. We detect abnormal audit fees by identifying actual fees that fall beyond an acceptable range of expected fees. We find that ensemble regressor outperforms linear, regularization and neural network regressors in audit fees prediction. Ensemble model reduces noise in data and improves overall prediction accuracy and robustness. Inverse RMSE weighted average outperforms equal weight average as it takes more weights from model with lower RMSE. Our experimental results show that audit fees consist of linear and nonlinear superposition features. Our hybrid model reduces overfitting in machine learning and yet provides model clarity from linear regression. We demonstrate an improved prediction performance and anomalies detection through hybrid model. Hybrid model is also effective in detecting anomalies in other mixed relationships such as housing and commodity prices specifically, corporate fraud, scandals, and compliance issues more generally.

Keywords: Anomaly Detection, Abnormal Audit Fees, Hybrid Model, Machine Learning, China
