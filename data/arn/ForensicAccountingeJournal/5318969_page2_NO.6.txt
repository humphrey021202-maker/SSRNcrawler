Abstract

In recent years, Gujarat has emerged as a hotspot for a sophisticated cybercrime known as "digital arrest," where fraudsters impersonate law enforcement or government officials to extort money from victims through fear and intimidation. These scams, involving fake CBI officers, police, or PMO officials, have defrauded individuals of crores, exploiting vulnerabilities in technology, governance, and human psychology. This article examines digital arrest scams in Gujarat, highlighting a notable case, analyzing demand and supply-side reasons, identifying loopholes in government and police systems, exploring corrupt practices, and assessing the roles of media, religion, social institutions, universities, research institutes, and societal factors like lack of awareness, greed, fear, and temptation.

Keywords: Digital Arrest, Cyber Fraud, Gujarat, Lack of Awareness

Ineffective Cybercrime Regulation: Despite the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C) blocking 59,000 WhatsApp accounts and 1,700 Skype IDs by December 2024, international operations remain hard to curb. Delayed Response Mechanisms: The "golden hour" (first 24 hours) for reporting cyber fraud is critical, but slow police action and low FIR conversion rates (due to small amounts or interstate issues) hinder justice. Gujarat reported 1,21,701 calls to the 1930 helpline in 2023, but few led to FIRs. Overburdened Agencies: The National Testing Agency (NTA) scandals and GST fraud probes in Gujarat reveal understaffed and overstretched agencies
Corruption in Law Enforcement: In Gujarat, cases of police demanding bribes to "unfreeze" accounts or resolve cybercrime complaints have surfaced. A 2024 ACB report revealed a cybercrime officer accepting bribes in EMIs, highlighting systemic graft. Lack of Training: Police are often ill-equipped to handle AI-driven crimes like deepfake scams, as noted by UP's cybercrime SP Triveni Singh. Political Interference: Investigations into GST frauds revealed
Challenges: Sensationalist reporting can amplify fear, deterring victims from reporting due to stigma. Media also fails to consistently educate on preventive measures, focusing more on high-profile cases. Potential: Media could collaborate with I4C to run sustained campaigns
Role of Media The media plays a dual role: Positive Impact: Outlets like Times of India and The Hindu report on digital arrest cases, raising awareness
Role of Religion and Social Institutions Religion and social institutions influence fraud dynamics: Exploitation of Trust: Scammers exploit cultural reverence for authority, often invoking fake court orders or Supreme Court judges, as seen in the Vardhman Group CMD's ₹7 crore fraud. Community Support: Religious and social groups could educate members, but many lack digital literacy programs. Assam's restrictions on interfaith land sales
