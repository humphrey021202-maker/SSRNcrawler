Abstract

Detecting fraudulent behavior in financial transactions is a complex challenge, especially as fraudsters continuously adapt their strategies. This study proposes a novel hybrid model that integrates Mix of Experts (MoE), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Transformers, and Autoencoders to capture both sequential patterns and anomalous deviations in agent behavior. By leveraging MoE's specialization capabilities, RNNs' temporal dependencies, Transformers' attention mechanisms, and Autoencoders' anomaly detection, the model provides a comprehensive detection system capable of adapting to evolving fraud patterns. The dataset used for this research is synthetic, simulating realistic credit card transaction behaviors, which include both typical and atypical patterns of user behavior. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC, demonstrating its superior ability to identify a wide range of fraudulent activities while minimizing false positives. The findings highlight the importance of a multidimensional approach in understanding agent behaviors, providing insights that extend beyond traditional fraud detection methods. This research not only contributes to theoretical advancements in the field of fraud detection but also offers practical solutions for real-world implementation in financial systems.
