Abstract

Abstract: This publication explores the accrual principle, a fundamental concept in accounting that ensures financial transactions are recorded in the period in which they occur, regardless of when cash is exchanged. The study defines the accrual principle, discuss its applications, advantages, criticisms and give examples of its impact on financial reporting. The study also delves into the relationship between the accrual principle and various other concepts, including the matching principle, revenue recognition principle, economic reality principle, decision usefulness theory, agency theory, and positive accounting theory, emphasizing how these principles and theories work together to ensure accurate financial reporting. Furthermore, the study addresses the challenges and opportunities presented by the accrual principle in the context of emerging financial technologies and systems.

Learners/Audience: This study serves a broad spectrum of learners across various academic stages, offering tailored insights into the accrual principle. For example, a first-year undergraduate student might benefit from foundational discussions on the definition, significance, and straightforward examples of the accrual principle to prepare for an introductory accounting assignment or class discussion. On the other hand, a graduate student could delve into the application of the accrual principle in complex financial reporting, while also exploring challenges and the technologies designed to address these issues. For a PhD candidate, the publication’s in-depth exploration of theoretical frameworks, controversies, and emerging trends in the accrual principle provides a fertile ground for identifying gaps in existing research or formulating novel hypotheses. By addressing the varied academic needs and objectives of its readers, this publication ensures comprehensive learning opportunities for students at all levels of expertise.

Learning Objectives: Upon completion of this study, students will be able to 1) Explain the accrual principle and its core concepts. 2) Understand the relationship between the accrual principle, the matching principle, and the revenue recognition principle. 3) Analyze motivations for accrual accounting through theoretical lenses. 4) Explain the challenges and opportunities in accrual accounting. 5) Explain the economic reality principle as a foundation for the accrual principle. 6) Analyze the impact of the accrual basis of accounting on financial transactions and performance.
