Abstract

The digitization of welfare systems has improved fraud detection and beneficiary authentication, yet it presents challenges in balancing fraud deterrence and accessibility. While biometric authentication, blockchain identity verification, and AI-driven fraud detection reduce fraudulent claims, strict authentication policies can wrongfully exclude eligible recipients, particularly marginalized populations. This chapter develops a Bayesian game-theoretic model to analyze how governments can strategically optimize authentication strictness and fraud detection accuracy to minimize fraud while maintaining accessibility. The Bayesian Nash Equilibrium (BNE) framework formalizes the interactions between government agencies, legitimate welfare recipients, and fraudsters, and determines the optimal policy trade-offs. The numerical experiment demonstrates that higher welfare benefits justify stricter authentication, while in low-welfare programs, fraud detection must be prioritized. Sensitivity analysis confirms that small policy adjustments significantly impact fraud deterrence efficiency.
