Abstract

This study investigates the relationship between Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) performance and the cost of capital among listed companies, aiming to assess whether firms with higher ESG scores enjoy lower costs of equity, debt, and overall capital. Drawing from stakeholder theory, signaling theory, and agency theory, the research posits that superior ESG practices enhance transparency, reduce perceived risk, and improve access to financial markets, thereby lowering the required return from investors and lenders. Employing a panel data analysis across multiple sectors and regions, the study expects to find a significant negative association between ESG scores and the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), with variations observed across ESG dimensions and firm-specific characteristics. The anticipated results suggest that ESG performance is financially material and has direct implications for corporate finance, investment decision-making, and sustainable financial policy. These findings could guide corporate managers, investors, and regulators in integrating ESG more strategically within valuation and capital structure decisions.

Keywords: ESG Performance, Cost of Capital, Listed Companies, Cost of Equity, Cost of Debt, WACC, Sustainability, Capital Markets, Stakeholder Theory, Signaling Theory
