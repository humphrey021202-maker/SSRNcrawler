Abstract

We calibrate logistic and machine learning models to estimate the prevalence of undetected financial misrepresentation. Assuming the ratio of costs of Type I and Type II classification errors falls between 1.5:1 and 1:1, the models imply 10% to 21% of Compustat-listed firms are engaged in sanctionable financial reporting practices in an average year. Violations average 3.3 years, implying 3.2% to 6.5% of firms initiate sanctionable financial reporting practices each year. We use these findings to estimate the share price distortions created by misrepresentation, firms' ex ante expected costs of violating reporting rules, and the social costs of financial misrepresentation.
