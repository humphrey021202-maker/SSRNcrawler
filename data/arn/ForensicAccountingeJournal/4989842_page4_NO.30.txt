Abstract

The emergence of data analytics allows auditors to test entire populations of transactions with evidence drawn from clients’ information systems, rather than relying solely on sampling methods. We examine whether auditors employing full population testing mistakenly substitute their assessment of evidence sufficiency for their evaluation of evidence appropriateness, leading them to view client-internal evidence as more appropriate than auditors using sample testing. Consequently, auditors using full population testing could be less likely to act skeptically when subsequent, more appropriate external evidence indicates that a fraud red flag is present. In an experiment, we find that auditors using full population testing, compared to sample testing, are less likely to exercise skeptical actions when subsequent external evidence, an industry growth trend, reveals a fraud red flag. Although visualizing versus tabulating the subsequent evidence generally improves auditors’ skepticism, we do not observe that visualizations mitigate the negative effect of full population testing.


Keywords: attribute substitution, external evidence, fraud, full population testing, professional skepticism
