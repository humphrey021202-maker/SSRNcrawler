Abstract

The increasing demand for transparent and holistic corporate reporting has led to the emergence of integrated reporting (IR) as a strategic tool for enhancing stakeholder decision-making. However, the effect of integrated reports on share price remains inconclusive, particularly in emerging markets where regulatory frameworks and corporate disclosure practices are evolving. This study investigates the effect of integrated reports on share price, with a focus on the control roles of firm profitability, leverage, and size. The purpose is to empirically examine whether the adoption and quality of IR significantly influence investor valuation and market performance. A panel data analysis was conducted on 127 publicly listed firms across diverse sectors in the Main Board of the NGX over 10 years (2014-2023), using a random effects regression model to establish the relationship between integrated reporting quality and share price. The study controlled for firm-specific variables such as profitability (ROA), leverage, and size, and accounted for regulatory changes introduced during the period under review. The findings reveal a statistically significant positive relationship between the quality of integrated reports and share price, suggesting that investors reward firms that provide comprehensive, transparent, and forward-looking information. Furthermore, firm profitability and size enhance this relationship, while high leverage weakens it. These results underline the relevance of integrated reporting in building investor confidence and market value. However, the study is limited by its geographic focus and data availability on IR scores, which may restrict generalisability. Practically, the research offers insights to managers, regulators, and investors by reinforcing the value relevance of integrated reporting. Socially, it promotes a culture of accountability and long-term sustainability in corporate reporting. The originality of this study lies in its nuanced examination of IR's impact on share price in a developing economy context, considering firm-level characteristics and regulatory evolution.
