Abstract

This study evaluates the impact of model interpretability and transparency in machine learning (ML)-based Anti-Money Laundering (AML) solutions deployed within financial institutions. With the increasing reliance on ML to detect and prevent money laundering activities, the research focuses on understanding how transparent models influence regulatory compliance, operational efficiency, and trust within financial organizations. Purpose of the Study: The primary purpose of this study is to assess the role of interpretability and transparency in improving the effectiveness and compliance of ML-driven AML systems. The research aims to identify the benefits and challenges that transparent ML models bring to financial institutions, especially in terms of reducing false positives, ensuring fairness, and complying with regulatory standards. Methodology: The study uses a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative interviews with financial compliance officers and AML experts to understand the practical challenges of implementing ML models. Additionally, quantitative analysis of model performance (e.g., false positive rates, detection accuracy) is conducted across a range of interpretable and non-interpretable ML models. This analysis is supplemented by case studies from financial institutions using both black-box and transparent ML solutions for AML detection.

Keywords: Evaluating the Impact of Model Interpretability, Transparency in Machine Learning-Based, Anti-Money Laundering Solutions for Financial Institutions
