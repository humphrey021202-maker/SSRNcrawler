Abstract

This study examines whether continuing education (CE) requirements deter investment adviser misconduct. Regulators often impose CE requirements to ensure professional service quality and protect clients from bad actors. Although CE requirements are widely used, causing firms to spend billions of dollars on CE each year, little is known about the effectiveness of CE. We exploit the staggered implementation of CE requirements by the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) to examine the impact of CE. While we do not find evidence that CE requirements impact average investment advisers, we find that CE requirements significantly reduce misconduct among high-risk advisers. This reduction in misconduct is concentrated in rules-based misconduct. We also find that CE requirements remain effective within firm environments prone to misconduct. These findings suggest that CE can serve as an effective regulatory tool to discipline bad actors in financial markets and should interest regulators who are concerned with maintaining professional competency through continuing education requirements.
