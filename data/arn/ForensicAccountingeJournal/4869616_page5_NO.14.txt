Abstract

Financial forensic evidence is more like an annual financial audit report that consists of financial records, proofs of annual transactions, hard or soft copy data regarding yearly income or outcomes. Financial forensics is often considered a prevention plan or initiative that focuses on the vulnerable aspects of a company or an organization. Through investigation financial forensic reduces the financial risk factors and also detects any harmful activities in the sector. This particular research paper is based on the financial forensic evidence and acceptability in the court of law, as in the judicial procedures proving the authenticity of a financial forensic report often gets a complex task. Also, forensic accounting is a conceptual practice that generally focuses on the investigation to find the misconduct activities in the organizational corporate system. The current study discussion also sheds light on the importance and implication of forensic accounting practices in the corporate financial world.

Because, the benefits, impact, and importance of financial forensic evidence and accounting can decorate the structure of the financial aspect of an organizational sector. Also, through this implication, the study will also address the challenges that would come up with audits and implementation of accounting investigation procedures.
