Abstract

Using Japanese key audit matter data, this study examines the determinants and consequences of using an auditor's expert. Our main findings are twofold: (1) auditors with more firmspecific knowledge or audit firms with greater industry expertise are less likely to use experts and (2) using experts is associated with higher audit fees among client firms audited by Big 4 audit firms. Our findings elucidate how audit teams strategically use experts in audit engagements and their effects on audit fees.

Keywords: Auditor's expert, Audit partner tenure, Firm-specific knowledge, Industry specialization, Audit firm tenure, Key audit matter JEL Classification Code: M42
