Abstract

Despite decades of failed anti-corruption efforts, most government organizations operate as if additional compliance-based efforts will curb corruption. This article offers an explanation for why many of the government ethics rules imposed on public agencies and their employees, and associated compliance-oriented efforts, fail and are often counterproductive, and suggests instead the adoption of values-based ethics programs and practices to reduce corruption. (This abstract is not in the original article)
