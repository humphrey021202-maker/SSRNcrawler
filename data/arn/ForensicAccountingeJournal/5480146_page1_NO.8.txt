Abstract

Local governments represent the foundational level of governance within the federal system. They hold a critical role in grassroots administration and service delivery. Nevertheless, there have been instances where accountability and transparency were insufficient, including noncompliance with established norms, standards, laws, and regulations, and various omissions, errors, irregularities, and financial malpractices. Forensic auditing is crucial for fostering accountability, transparency, and ethical management of public resources.
