The Paradox of Preparer Fraud

Date Written: June 4, 2016

Abstract

Adam S. Wallwork is an Attorney in the New York City office of Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt LLC, where his practice focuses on federal income taxation. Mr. Wallwork provides a novel look at the Tax Court’s doctrine of preparer fraud, which recently provoked a circuit split. He shows that that doctrine is inconsistent with the language of Code Sec. 6501(c)(1)’s fraudulent-return exception, as well as its history and policy. The article also presents empirical evidence that this new tax policy actually increases fraud in the name of preventing it.

Note: This article is reprinted with the publisher’s permission from the Taxes The Tax Magazine®, a monthly journal published by Wolters Kluwer.
