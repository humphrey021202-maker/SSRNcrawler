Abstract

This paper explores spillover effects of financial reporting fraud across firms connected through industry and ownership ties. Leveraging the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC’s) Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Releases (AAERs) as indicators of financial reporting fraud, we test whether public disclosures about financial reporting fraud have deterrent or contagion effects on peers' financial reporting quality. Following the onset of a triggering announcement and subsequent AAER publication, we find that only ownership-connected peers exhibit an improvement in financial reporting quality. By contrast, our results give no support for industry-connected peers adjusting their financial reporting quality at both trigger event or AAER publication. When examining the violation period, marking the preceding period of SEC’s official enforcement, our falsification test verifies that adjustments in financial reporting quality are driven by public enforcement activities. Our findings extend the growing literature on peer effects, regulatory enforcement, and common ownership dynamics.

Keywords: Fraud, SEC Enforcement, AAER, Spillover
