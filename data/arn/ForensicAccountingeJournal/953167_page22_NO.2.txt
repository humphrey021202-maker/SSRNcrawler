Abstract

Drug Dealers, white collar criminals and organized crime groups motivated by profit look at New Jersey as a safe haven when conducting financial transactions with their crime tainted money. New Jersey state legislators have passed a series of anti-money laundering provisions that provide law enforcement with powerful tools designed to take the profit out of crime and bring money launderers to justice. This article examines New Jersey's money laundering statutes and their potential contribution in bringing profit motivated criminals to justice.
