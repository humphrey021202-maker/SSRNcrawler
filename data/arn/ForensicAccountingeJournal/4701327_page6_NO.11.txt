Abstract

This case provides an opportunity to gain experience in ethical thinking about occupational fraud risk in a small, family-owned business setting. We apply the IMA Statement of Ethical Professional Practice to a brief, fictional ethical dilemma with relatable and real-world applications to the professional workplace. Julian Torres, an accountant at a health care supply company, discovers significant differences between actual and budgeted inventory costs during the preparation of his monthly flexible budget report. Upon further investigation, a coworker informs him that the purchasing director may be receiving bribes from one of Kundera’s new vendors. Julian’s friendship with his coworker, as well as the purchasing director’s status at the company, complicates his ethical decision.

Keywords: Bribery, Fraud, Ethics, Flexible Budget Reports, Internal Controls, IMA Statement of Ethical Professional Practice
