Abstract

This study examines the potential of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) to improve auditors' fraud risk assessments. Using two experiments with experienced and novice auditors, we show that GenAI significantly enhances fraud risk identification, enabling auditors to identify more total and highly-relevant fraud risks without increasing irrelevant risks, while also improving task efficiency. Notably, novice auditors with access to GenAI identified more relevant fraud risks than experienced auditors without GenAI. A third experiment demonstrates that almost all fully automated GenAI tools outperform human auditors with AI along the same dimensions. However, results from three additional experiments show no clear benefits to human use of GenAI for audit planning adjustments in response to identified fraud risks. Overall, evidence from 1,100 practicing auditors across six experiments provide important evidence on audit tasks that benefit from GenAI-and those that do not.

Keywords: Generative AI, Fraud Risk Assessment, Audit Quality, AI in Auditing, Audit Planning
