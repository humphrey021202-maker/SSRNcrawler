Abstract

Based on the data of Chinese listed companies, this paper examines the impact of anti-corruption on accounting conservatism. We find that anti-corruption can significantly improve accounting conservatism, especially in companies with weak internal control, high proportion of large shareholders and weak investor protection. At the same time,through further research,we find that state-owned private enterprises are more conducive to play the positive role of anti-corruption in improving accounting conservatism. In addition, the role of external supervision governance should be brought into play in order to enhance accounting conservatism, thus, the quality of accounting information can be further improved.

Keywords: Anti-Corruption, Accounting Conservatism, the Quality of Accounting Information
