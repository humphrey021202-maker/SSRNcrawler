Abstract

We examine the direct impact of crypto platform fraud on victims’ investing behavior using transaction-level data on money transfers to trading platforms. Using the 2021 Coinseed fraud revelation, we find fraud substantially erodes victims’ trust, prompting them to curtail new investments on both the fraudulent and other crypto platforms. The effect persists for at least one year and is stronger among individuals with higher financial literacy, who better incorporate information about the fraud. Furthermore, the effect spills over to investments on traditional brokerage platforms. Overall, our findings offer new insights into how personal experiences with crypto fraud influence investing behavior.

Keywords: fraud, crypto markets, cryptocurrency, individual investors, trust, capital markets, transaction data, spillover effects

JEL Classification: G10, G40, G50, M40, D10, D90
