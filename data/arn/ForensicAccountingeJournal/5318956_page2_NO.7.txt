Harnessing Forensic Science to Combat Fraud in Gujarat

Abstract

Gujarat has recently seen a significant rise in complex fraudulent activities, shaking public trust and challenging law enforcement and the judiciary. These schemes range from digital arrests and fake courts with impersonated officials (including PMO officials, judges, collectors, and various tax and investigative officers) to forged land documents, bogus medical institutions and professionals, and even counterfeit currency, passports, visas, and banks. Such widespread deception not only undermines the stability of our institutions but also demands a robust response. This is where forensic science becomes crucial. Forensic science, with its diverse tools and methodologies, is essential for preventing, detecting, and controlling these crimes, as well as for verifying evidence. It plays a pivotal role in supporting police investigations and ensuring that justice is served in Gujarat's courts.

Keywords: Fraud, Gujarat, Impersonation, Digital Arrest, Forensic Science
