Abstract

Sanction evasion undermines the effectiveness of economic sanctions. This study applies unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms to firm-level financial data to identify companies potentially engaged in sanction evasion. Based on economic reasoning, hypotheses are developed on how sanction-busting activities might manifest in financial statements. Using firm data from the Orbis database, three detection techniques (univariate outlier detection, Mahalanobis distance, and Local Outlier Factor) are employed to flag anomalous firms, and a RIPPER rule-based classifier further categorizes detected anomalies based on financial characteristics. The results show that unsupervised anomaly detection effectively identifies firms warranting further investigation, with three out of eight web-searched firms exhibiting economic ties to Russia post-2022. These findings demonstrate that financial anomalies can serve as an indicator of suspicious business activity, warranting closer scrutiny by regulators.
