Abstract

This study examines whether board ownership, defined as the proportion of company shares held by board members, encourages the adoption of a dividend payout policy among publicly traded firms. The underlying problem is the persistent ambiguity in the relationship between managerial ownership and dividend distribution, particularly in emerging markets where corporate governance mechanisms are often weak or poorly enforced. The purpose of this study is to determine if shared ownership among board members aligns their interests with those of shareholders in a manner that promotes regular dividend payments. Using a quantitative research design, the study employed panel data from a sample of 104 non-financial firms listed on the Nigerian Exchange between 2007 and 2023. A random effects model (REM) regression was applied to evaluate the influence of board ownership on dividend payout, controlling for firm size, profitability, and leverage. The findings indicate a positive and statistically significant relationship between board ownership and dividend payout ratio. This suggests that when board members hold substantial equity stakes, they are more inclined to authorize dividend payments, likely as a means of self-benefit and signaling firm stability to the market. However, the study is limited by its focus on a single emerging market, the exclusion of financial firms due to their unique regulatory environment, and the use of only one corporate governance mechanism. The implications are notable for shareholders, regulators, and policymakers. Encouraging equity participation among directors may be a viable strategy for improving shareholder returns and mitigating agency conflicts. This study contributes original insight to the ownership-structure-dividend literature by offering empirical evidence from an underexplored context and reinforcing the notion that insider ownership can act as a disciplinary tool in corporate governance.
