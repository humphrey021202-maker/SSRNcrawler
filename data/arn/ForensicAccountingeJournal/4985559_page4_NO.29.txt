Abstract

This study has two main objectives. First, it refreshes investigations into research productivity within the accounting and finance domains across Australian and New Zealand higher education institutions from 2011 to 2022. Second, it reflects on affirmative action in Australia, arguing that its impact on women’s experiences should extend beyond mere numerical measures. Analysing 48 top journals reveals a steady increase in research output with notable contributions from the University of New South Wales, Monash University, the University of Sydney, the University of Melbourne, and the University of Queensland. Authors with five or more publications rank in the top 5%, highlighting the difficulty of achieving prolific publishing. Significantly, gender diversity improved, with female authorship rising from 19.27% to 31.73%, indicating a shift towards more inclusive research environments. However, a persistent gender gap among highly published authors suggests ongoing challenges. The study also examines job mobility among top contributors, offering insights into career progression within the academic community. Overall, the findings provide new insights into research productivity, the impact of affirmative action on gender diversity, and career mobility within the academic field of accounting and finance.

Keywords: Research productivity, higher education institutions (HEIs), affirmative action, gender diversity, university rankings, academic mobility
