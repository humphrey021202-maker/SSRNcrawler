Abstract

Tax fraud poses a persistent challenge to the Tigray Revenue Development Authority (TRDA), significantly undermining tax collection and overall revenue performance. Existing manual detection methods are often inadequate for identifying complex fraud patterns within the growing volume of taxpayer data. This study proposes an integrated framework that combines predictive data mining techniques with a knowledge-based system (KBS) to enhance fraud detection and prevention capabilities within TRDA.The research utilizes historical taxpayer data sourced from TRDA's SIGTAS and TITCOS systems. Data preprocessing was carried out using SQL Management and Visual Studio .Net. Taxpayers were grouped into three clusters using K-means clustering. Classification algorithms—J48, Naive Bayes, and JRip—were applied using WEKA to identify the most effective predictive model. Among these, JRip achieved the highest accuracy (99.964%) and was selected for integration into the KBS.The rules derived from JRip were encoded into a knowledge base using Java (Apache NetBeans), while PROLOG was used to develop the user interface and integration shell, allowing seamless interaction with the fraud detection system. The prototype underwent rigorous testing, including user acceptance and system performance evaluations, achieving 92.0% and 87.5% success rates, respectively.The results affirm the effectiveness of combining machine learning with rule-based reasoning to detect fraudulent tax behavior in real time. This hybrid approach significantly improves detection accuracy and user interaction. The system demonstrates strong potential for operational deployment, offering a scalable, intelligent solution to support TRDA in protecting public revenue from fraudulent activities.
