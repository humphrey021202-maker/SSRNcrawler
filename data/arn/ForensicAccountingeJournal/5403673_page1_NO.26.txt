Abstract

This study investigates the influence of corporate governance mechanisms, specifically board independence, institutional ownership, audit committee, and external audit, on the quality of integrated reporting. Despite growing interest in integrated reporting as a tool for enhancing corporate transparency, its quality remains inconsistent, raising concerns about the efficacy of governance structures in ensuring reliable disclosures. The purpose of this research is to explore how these governance mechanisms contribute to the quality of integrated reporting, considering both internal and external factors. A quantitative approach was employed, analyzing a sample of firms from diverse sectors using panel data regression models. Key findings suggest that board independence and institutional ownership positively impact integrated reporting quality, as these mechanisms enhance oversight and align managerial decisions with long-term shareholder interests. Similarly, the presence of a strong audit committee and the engagement of external auditors were found to improve the reliability and comprehensiveness of integrated reports. However, the study also reveals that firm size, leverage, and profitability moderate these relationships, influencing the effectiveness of governance mechanisms in different contexts. Limitations include the cross-sectional nature of the data, which limits the ability to establish causal relationships. The research contributes to the understanding of corporate governance in the context of integrated reporting, offering practical implications for policymakers and companies seeking to improve reporting quality. This study also carries social implications by promoting greater transparency in corporate practices.

Keywords: Audit Committee, Board Independence, External Audit, Firm Leverage, Firm Profitability, Firm Size, Integrated Reporting Quality, Institutional Ownership
