Abstract

Japanese companies in the 1980s were looked upon as the models for business innovation. Admired by the rest of the world for manufacturing efficiency and business strategy, Japanese companies were renowned for pioneering management techniques such as kaizen, target costing, and flexible manufacturing. Yet in recent years, the Japanese economy has experienced a spate of corporate scandals.

Facing business setbacks, companies altered product data, hid losses, and even resorted to issuing misleading financial reports. Shareholder value was damaged, and consumers were outraged. What changed, and how could these scandals have been avoided?

Keywords: Japanese, Corporate Governance, Fraud, Olympus, Toshiba, Price-Masking
