Abstract

We examine whether major corporate customers can deter misconduct among their suppliers. Our findings indicate that firms with concentrated customer bases are less likely to commit misconduct and face lower penalties in equilibrium. We also observe a significant decline in supplier misconduct following the establishment of a major customer relationship. Furthermore, the deterrent effect of major customers is more pronounced when customer pressure to reduce supplier misconduct risk is higher. Additional analyses suggest that major customers exercise their exit option to penalize suppliers after acute violations. Overall, our results suggest that major customers play a crucial role in deterring supplier misconduct. 

Keywords: Misconduct, major customer, supplier, monitoring, self-discipline
