Abstract

White-collar crimes and cybercrime activities continue to rise, causing not only immediate financial damages but also lasting impacts on corporate governance, shareholder trust, and long-term financial health. This research examines how materiality thresholds and cybersecurity frameworks influence the detection, reporting, and prevention of fraudulent activities. Using data from the 2024 ENISA Threat Landscape Report, 2024 ITRC Data Breach Report, 2023 FBI Internet Crime Report, and the 2024 ACFE Report to the Nations, along with a review of 10-K disclosures from companies impacted by material breaches, this study explores the multidimensional consequences of fraud from 2019 to 2024. Results reveal that fraud events classified as high materiality, with losses exceeding $500 million, are associated with greater detection rates, enhanced financial statement transparency, and more extensive risk disclosures. Additionally, other cybercrimes have emerged as key drivers of increasing fraud losses. By going beyond the balance sheet, this research highlights the need for stronger internal controls, clearer materiality standards, and improved cybersecurity governance to enhance corporate resilience and the integrity of financial reporting in today’s evolving digital economy.
