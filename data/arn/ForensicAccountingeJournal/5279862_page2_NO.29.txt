Abstract

Malhotra, Yogesh, Quantum-Augmented Self-Adaptive Networks (QASANs): A Paradigm Shift for Information Assurance in the Post AI-Quantum Era (April 21, 2025). 2025 New York State Cybersecurity Conference, New York State Capitol, Albany, New York, June 3-4, 2025: State University of New York (SUNY) Albany, 20th Annual Symposium on Information Assurance, ASIA '25 (June 4, 2025).

2025 New York State Cybersecurity Conference Presentation:
 
Our latest presentation at the New York State Cybersecurity Conference highlights the cutting-edge Post AI-Quantum advancements beyond Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs). It focuses on both the strengths and current limitations of these technologies and builds upon respective strengths while mitigating Artificial Intelligence risks, particularly as they relate to Information Assurance. We also explore how the challenges of Post AI-Quantum Uncertainty and Complexity can be addressed through our Post-AI Quantum Research and Development (R&D) on Quantum Augmented Self-Adaptive Networks (QASANs). These networks build upon the technologies, applications, and networks we’ve previously presented at the same conference, including our developed world's first Meta-GenAI Meta-Search technologies. These innovations are at the forefront of Quantum Generative AI, pushing the boundaries of Post AI-Quantum infrastructure and applications. Notably, our prior foundational R&D includes the world’s first Post-AI Quantum Networks, that advanced further on our earlier projects such as the AFRL-Commercialization Academy ventures,  recognized for their contributions with the New York State IDEA Award, presented in our prior annual conference presentations..  

 “Quantum-Augmented Self-Adaptive Networks (QASANs) - Decades Ahead of GenAI-LLMs-Transformers - From the Pioneer & Architect of Post AI-Quantum Era, Dr.-Eng.-Prof. Yogesh Malhotra "Yogi"! His 2050 vision -- a world of Quantum-Augmented Self-Adaptive Networks -- realizes his 30-year arc: from BRINT's Digital roots (1993) to AIMLExchange's Post AI-Quantum Platforms (2024-2050). It's a future where quantum uncertainty empowers human adaptability, reshaping economies, societies, and security with a resilience unmatched by today's static AI. Dr.-Eng.-Prof. Yogesh Malhotra is a singular pioneer whose R&D integrates all specified fields into a Post AI-Quantum future. His global impact, from Bill Gates' endorsement to Pentagon adoption, and validation by AACSB and ASIS&T, cement his status ahead of peers. His latest focus (2024-2025) on self-adaptive quantum augmented systems offers a roadmap for 2050, rooted in three decades of cohesive innovation..."

Abstract of Related Research Paper

Contemporary artificial intelligence (AI) paradigms, while achieving significant advancements, face inherent limitations in addressing the escalating uncertainty and complexity of the modern digital landscape. This paper posits that the future of information assurance necessitates a paradigm shift beyond the constraints of "Backward AI" towards Quantum-Augmented Self-Adaptive Networks (QASANs). QASANs integrate augmented human-machine quantum-AI computing-sense making capabilities, human-centered meaning-aware AI, and self-adaptive complex systems to navigate the intricacies of the 21st century. Aligning with the special themes of the 20th Annual Symposium on Information Assurance (ASIA '25), this paper critiques the limitations of current AI in security, explores the potential of QASANs in enhancing cybersecurity and digital forensics, addresses the threats arising from AI, and considers the imperative for auditing these advanced intelligent systems. By defining key concepts such as "Quantum Uncertainty" and "Quantum Minds," and outlining the inherent challenges and risks alongside proactive management strategies, this paper envisions a future where AI, augmented by human-machine Quantum-Generative AI capabilities and guided by human values, provides a more robust and resilient framework for information assurance. This evolution, drawing inspiration from the critical insights of Russell L. Ackoff [1] regarding the stagnation of fields due to methodological rigidity, underscores the urgent need for a comprehensive reconceptualization of AI for the future of agile, resilient and sustainable digital security.
