Abstract

The capital structure decisions of firms remain central to corporate finance discourse, with ownership structure emerging as a critical determinant of leverage. Despite extensive literature, inconsistencies persist regarding how varying ownership types influence firms' debt usage, particularly in emerging economies. This study investigates the effects of ownership structure, specifically managerial, institutional, and foreign ownership, on corporate leverage among publicly listed firms. The purpose is to provide empirical clarity and offer policy-relevant insights into ownership-induced capital structure behavior. Employing panel data from 127 firms listed on the Main Board of the Nigerian Exchange (NGX) over 10 years (2014-2023), the study utilizes random effects regression models to analyze the relationship. Findings reveal that institutional ownership has a positive and significant effect on leverage, suggesting confidence in debt-financed growth, while managerial ownership is negatively associated with leverage, reflecting risk aversion and entrenchment concerns. Foreign ownership exerts a mixed effect, depending on the level of control. The study is limited by its focus on one national context and Main Board firms. Practically, the findings inform policymakers, investors, and corporate managers on optimal ownership configurations for balanced financing. Socially, the research underscores ownership as a governance mechanism influencing corporate accountability. The study contributes original empirical evidence from a frontier market context.
