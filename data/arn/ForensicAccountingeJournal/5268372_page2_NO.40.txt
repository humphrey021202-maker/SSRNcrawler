Abstract

This proposal introduces the DFAS-IFRS Code of Ethics v1.0 to address the ethical gaps that artificial intelligence (AI) creates in financial reporting. As AI increasingly drives valuations, impairments, and forecasts, existing IFRS principles lack mechanisms to ensure explainability, traceability, and auditability. We designed the DFAS-IFRS Code as a modular overlay that builds on the DFAS-FEP Protocol and aligns directly with the IFRS Conceptual Framework. The Code defines seven enforceable principles that govern AI use in financial models, mandate human override accountability, and prohibit unverifiable logic. We classify models into four tiers based on the DFAS-AI Contribution Score (DFAS-ACS), assigning clear audit and disclosure responsibilities. We also provide implementation pathways through pilot programs, Conceptual Framework appendices, or IFRIC interpretations. To support adoption, we developed practical tools for SMEs, auditors, and regulators, including trace logs, override forms, and classification checklists.
