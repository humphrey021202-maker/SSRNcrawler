Abstract

This paper investigates whether employees with criminal records assist CEOs with criminal records in altering financial reporting. Using proprietary administrative data from Denmark on all employees’ criminal records, two main findings emerge. First, CEOs with criminal records tend to employ people with criminal records, which is consistent with homophily in CEOs’ hiring practices. Second, the association between CEOs’ criminal records and financial reporting quality is more pronounced when a high proportion of employees have criminal records. This suggests that employing like-minded employees can help CEOs with criminal records alter financial reporting. The results illuminate one channel through which CEOs influence firm outcomes.

Keywords: Rank-and-file employees; financial reporting quality; criminal records; homophily

JEL Classification: E24, G41, M12, M41, M54
