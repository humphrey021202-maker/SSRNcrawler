Abstract

Blockchain technology has gained significant attention due to its transparent and decentralized nature. The inherent pseudonymity in blockchain transactions, however, poses challenges in identifying malicious entities engaging in illicit activities. This research proposes a groundwork for implementing a real-time monitoring tool incorporating automated graph modeling and generalized graph algorithms to enhance informed decision-making for forensic analysts, law enforcement, and regulatory authorities about suspicious transactions in blockchain networks. The proposed approach enables users to interact directly with the blockchain data using graph queries, gaining insights into the network’s overall structure and efficiently identifying patterns and anomalies. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated on five real-world blockchain network datasets. The results demonstrate the significance of graph-based modeling and visualization techniques in identifying suspicious nodes and offering practical guidance for decision-making by end-users in combating illicit activities exploiting blockchain networks.

Keywords: blockchain, graph-based visualization, behavioral patterns, financial crimes, and algorithms
