Abstract

This study examines the function of behavioral forensics in accounting and analyzes the psychological characteristics of financial fraudsters. It underscores the significance of amalgamating psychological insights with conventional forensic accounting methodologies to improve fraud detection and prevention. The study is founded on a survey of 100 professionals in forensic accounting, auditing, fraud examination, and financial crime investigation. The results indicate that financial fraudsters frequently display specific psychological characteristics, including Machiavellianism, narcissism, and psychopathy, reinforcing the notion that fraudulent conduct is both an economic and a behavioral concern. The study further substantiates that behavioral forensic techniques surpass traditional methods in fraud detection efficacy. Nevertheless, obstacles, including a shortage of qualified professionals, organizational resistance, and ethical dilemmas, impede the extensive implementation of these techniques. The study recommends incorporating behavioral forensics into forensic accounting education, professional training programs, and AI and machine learning for real-time fraud detection. This research enhances the knowledge of behavioral forensics and provides insights into adapting forensic accounting for improved detection and prevention of financial fraud.

Keywords: Behavioral Forensics, Financial Fraud, Forensic Accounting, Fraud Detection, Fraud Triangle, Behavioral Red Flags, Psychological Traits, Machiavellianism, Narcissism, Psychopathy, Fraud Prevention, AI in Fraud Detection, Behavioral Profiling, Forensic Accounting Education
