Abstract

Abstract
This paper performs a forensic analysis of Qualcomm Inc.’s transfer pricing cost sharing arrangement based on forensic economic analysis of public and information, including Qualcomm’s SEC and foreign country regulatory filings, documents disclosed during a recent federal court trial, and other sources. This periodic adjustment is not be limited by any statute of limitations as long as the arrangement continues. The IRS however has historically not enforced the periodic adjustment regulations of Section 1.482-7(i)(6) since they became effective on January 5, 2009. Qualcomm’s non-compliance with these regulations and its exposure to this tax risk has never to the author’s knowledge been reflected in its SEC filings.

Keywords: Transfer Pricing, Auditing, Forensic Economics, Tax Compliance and Tax Enforcement
