Abstract

This Article describes the forensic accounting and valuation tools available to Delaware litigators in commercial and corporate litigation as well as family law. Further, it details the licensing process and standards applicable to forensic accountants and shows how the methods utilized in this profession can assist litigators in a variety of contexts. Delaware cases in which courts have accepted or limited the use of expert forensic accountant testimony are explored and general principles for utilizing forensic accounting expertise in Delaware litigation are developed. The uses of forensic accounting in Delaware litigation are demonstrated across appraisal actions, divorce cases, fraud and fiduciary actions and investigations, and economic damages estimation.

Keywords: Delaware litigation, forensic accounting tools, valuation tools, expert forensic accountant testimony, business valuation, financial fraud, economic damages estimation, Delaware Rules of Evidence, forensic accountants, Daubert, Association of International Certified Public Accountants, AICPA
