Abstract

This study examines the patterns in the operational expenditures of the Papua Provincial Government, drawing insights from audit reports provided by the Supreme Audit Agency. It focuses on four key categories of operational spending: personnel expenses, goods and services expenditures, grants, and social assistance. Leveraging ChatGPT for report content analysis the research uncovers: recurring issues, ineffective internal controls, misallocations in funds, and inadequate oversight. The findings underscore the need for stronger management commitment, more robust internal controls, improved data management, and greater financial transparency to promote more accountable use of public funds.
