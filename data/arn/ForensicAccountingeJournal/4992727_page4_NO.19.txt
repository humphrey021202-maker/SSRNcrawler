Abstract

Fraud in the banking sector poses a significant threat to the Nigerian economy, contributing notably to bank failures and operational distress. This study identifies prevalent bank fraud types, investigates their underlying causes, assesses staff involvement, and discusses consequences and potential solutions. The specific objectives include examining the root causes of fraud currently threatening the Nigerian banking sector. Four hypotheses were formulated for investigation. Data were collected through primary questionnaires distributed to five selected commercial banks, employing statistical analysis techniques such as chisquare tests and percentages. The research revealed that greed is a major contributor to bank fraud, leading to diminished bank performance. Recommendations include conducting thorough background checks before hiring key personnel and ensuring competitive remuneration for employees.
