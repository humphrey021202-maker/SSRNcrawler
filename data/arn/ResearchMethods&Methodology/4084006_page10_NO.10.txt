Abstract

We construct a measure of revenue recognition timing based on the sensitivity of reported revenue to aggregate industry key performance indicators (KPIs) and validate it using historical financial restatements. Applying this measure, we find that approximately half of U.S. publicly traded firms accelerated revenue recognition following the adoption of ASC 606. To assess the decision usefulness of this acceleration, we examine its impact on financial analysts and investors. We find that accelerated recognition is associated with lower analyst forecast error and dispersion through 2024.  In contrast, we observe no significant change in investors’ reactions to revenue surprises. This divergence suggests that ASC 606’s shift in recognition timing had a more pronounced impact on analysts’ forecasting activities than on stock returns.

Keywords: revenue recognition, ASC 606, ASU 2014-09, ASU 2015-14, IFRS 15, FASB, IASB, sales contracts with customers, analyst forecast, industry KPI
