Abstract

For testing error variance unstability, a test based on CUSUM squares of the residuals in HAR (Heteroscedastic AutoRegressive) models are constructed and its limiting null distribution is derived to be a simple function of the standard Brownian bridge. A finite sample Monte-Carlo experiment shows reasonable size and power of the proposed test. The test is applied to the realized volatilities of the log-returns of some stock price index and exchange rate to find evidences of variance unstability after adjusting long-memories.

Keywords: HAR model, long-memory, parameter constancy, realized volatility, structural break
