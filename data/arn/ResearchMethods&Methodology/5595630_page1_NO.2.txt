Abstract

We investigate whether board structures mitigate self-dealing in SMEs, a context marked by concentrated ownership, limited transparency, and weak external monitoring. Drawing on Swedish adjudicated self-dealing cases between 2000-2025, we construct comparison groups of non-adjudicated firms matched either on firm-level observables, director identity, or a combination of both, to test our hypotheses. Board independence, measured through interlocks or proxies for family and social ties, shows no consistent association with misconduct, suggesting that in SMEs independence often lacks substantive force. Gender diversity, whether measured incrementally or at critical-mass thresholds, likewise does not reduce hazard. By contrast, director busyness is negatively associated with misconduct when identification tightens, consistent with reputational incentives outweighing time-constraint concerns. Methodologically, the study demonstrates how triangulated matched designs can disentangle influence from selection in rare-event settings. For regulators and lenders, strengthening accountability and raising reputational costs for directors may be more effective in curbing selfdealing than mandating independence or diversity alone. Leadership separation remains valuable but should be complemented by mechanisms that enhance director's responsibility across board portfolios.
