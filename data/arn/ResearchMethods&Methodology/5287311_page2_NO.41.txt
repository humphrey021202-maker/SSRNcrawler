Abstract

This article explores essential concepts for professionals working in actuarial science, quantitative finance, and machine learning, focusing on the role of the Dickey-Fuller Test and Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test in validating time series stationarity. For actuaries, it strengthens the statistical foundation behind cash flow projections and reserve modeling. Financial modelers will find insights into improving ARIMA-based forecasts, understanding unit root behavior, and ensuring model assumptions hold true before drawing inferences. For machine learning practitioners, especially those applying temporal models like RNNs or LSTMs, this article highlights why checking for stationary inputs, autocorrelation, and lag structures can significantly impact model performance. By bridging statistical theory with application, the article reinforces best practices in time series diagnostics, model validation, and risk analytics. .

Keywords: Dickey-Fuller Test, Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test (ADF), unit root testing, time series stationarity, nonstationary data, autocorrelation, lag structure, ARIMA modeling, forecasting accuracy, statistical diagnostics, model validation
