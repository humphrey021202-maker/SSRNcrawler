Abstract

I propose factor models which use low-cost liquid hedging instruments to yield directly-actionable hedges. I combine the liquid instruments to create less-correlated liquid factors and introduce an estimation method to further handle multicollinearity and stabilize estimates. Analyzing the universe of US-listed exchange-traded funds shows that liquid factor models have explanatory power similar to or exceeding other factor models, yield more stable coefficients out-of-sample which may reduce unnecessary re-hedging and costs, and that these benefits are relatively stronger for significant coefficients and out to at least one quarter. Furthermore, these benefits hold for diverse asset classes and even some foreign assets. This suggests liquid factor models give us cheap ways to alter factor exposures, which is crucial for large portfolios that are not easily altered, work across asset classes, and may help better estimate fund alphas.
