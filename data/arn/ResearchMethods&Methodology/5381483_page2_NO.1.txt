Abstract

We examine whether investor characteristics create barriers to accessing corporate insiders-an important information channel in financial markets. Using a pre-registered 2×2×2 field experiment, we send meeting requests from fictious investors to 2,731 U.S. public companies, systematically manipulating investor race (Black and White), gender (female and male), and type (retail and professional). We find evidence of racial discrimination: White investors receive meeting approvals 34% more often than Black investors. This disparity persists across investor types, suggesting taste-based rather than statistical discrimination. Gender discrimination manifests differently-we find no statistically significant differences in initial meeting access, but conditional on securing meetings, female investors are 62% less likely to be offered a meeting with C-suite executives. Investor type alone does not affect meeting access, challenging assumptions about the differential treatment of retail investors versus professional investors. These findings reveal that informal barriers to information access vary systematically by investor characteristics, advancing our understanding of discrimination in financial markets and providing insight into the landscape of corporate information access.
