Abstract

In this chapter we argue that behavioural accounting experimental researchers (BAR researchers) are particularly well-positioned to answer the call to deepen our understanding of accounting practice by conducting research that directly studies the practitioner's experiences. As we see it, BAR researchers develop five key competencies (among others) through their education and research that can be leveraged to conduct experience based (or experiential) research. These competencies are: familiarity with a broad range of theories, close engagement with practice, selection of appropriate participants, focus on ex-ante instrument design, and careful measurement of underlying constructs. We argue that these five competencies enable BAR researchers to readily conduct positivist qualitative field studies that facilitate systematic development of theory-based (or informed) evidence about current accounting practices. We focus on positivist field research (as opposed to interpretivist or social construction based field research) as BAR researchers are positivist by their training that emphasizes deductive theory use and experimentation to understanding the forces at work in the environment. We elaborate on positivist field research methods and demonstrate how each of BAR researchers' key competencies equips them to employ these methods. We conclude our chapter with a discussion of the challenges encountered by positivist field researchers in a research milieu where their senior peers are mostly from a significantly different research tradition.
