Abstract

Textual similarity has drawn much attention in the recent literature of accounting and related fields. There has been, however, limited work to systematically test and validate its measures. In this paper I conduct three incremental studies to comprehensively test and validate the commonly used cosine similarity (COS) method. The results show that the 5-gram COS measure (based on phrases of five consecutive words) is a viable approach to assessing textual similarity. In addition, I develop a new scale termed boundary n-gram (the longest match that can be found in two texts) to obtain complementary information about textual similarity.

Keywords: Textual Similarity, Cosine Similarity, n-gram, Construct Validation, Textual Research Method
