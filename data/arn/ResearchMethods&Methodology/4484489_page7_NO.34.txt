Abstract

Researchers often examine narrative text in aggregate, but this approach can obscure economically important variation across specific accounting topics. Existing approaches to identifying topics covered in disclosures, such as reliance on commercial data aggregators, manual classification, or early forms of topic modeling, each have limitations that can hinder timely, resource-efficient, and accurate investigation. To address these limitations, we develop a domain-specific small language model that embeds accounting knowledge from authoritative reporting standards and classifies accounting topics efficiently in large volumes of unstructured narrative financial disclosures. We apply the model to MD&A text and show that topic-specific measures of disclosure content reveal insights missed by aggregate analyses. Topic-level variation predicts regulatory scrutiny (SEC comment letters), financial misstatements, and market reaction, relationships that are obscured when disclosures are studied only in the aggregate. Our study demonstrates the importance of disaggregating narrative disclosures into accounting topics and provides a practical tool for researchers seeking to better understand distinct areas of financial reporting.

Keywords: Disaggregation, Small language model, Llama-2, Accounting topics, Topic classification, Textual analysis, MD&A
