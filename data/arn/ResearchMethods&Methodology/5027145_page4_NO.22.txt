Abstract

Effective governance at the barangay level is a cornerstone of community development in the Philippines. This study systematically reviews existing literature to explore the governance practices, challenges, and community perceptions of Barangay Captains, who serve as pivotal figures in local administration. Utilizing the PRISMA framework, the study identifies critical themes, including best practices in leadership, transparency, and public service delivery, while also addressing barriers such as limited resources, insufficient training, and political dynamics. Findings emphasize the importance of participatory governance, fiscal accountability, and continuous capacity building in enhancing public trust and governance effectiveness. Recommendations include prioritizing community engagement, improving resource management, and institutionalizing training programs for Barangay Captains. The insights provided aim to inform policymakers and local leaders in fostering more inclusive and responsive governance frameworks.
