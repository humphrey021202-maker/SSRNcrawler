Abstract

This study examines the opportunities and challenges of using necessary conditions in
empirical accounting research for identifying causal relationships. Accounting research aims
to draw causal inferences notwithstanding that causal relationships can be understood both by
necessary and sufficient conditions. A necessary variable must be present for an outcome to
exist, where sufficient variables contribute to the outcome. In this study, we introduce necessary
conditions that have a distinct understanding of causal relationships. While our review finds
that some papers already use necessary conditions, there are doubts that typical specificities
when identifying a necessity condition are not always fully appreciated. We believe that
accounting research would benefit from the use of necessary conditions for refining the
understanding of causal relationships between variables. More attention to necessary
conditions in research settings provide more confidence to draw causal inferences.

Keywords: necessary condition analysis, NCA, necessity, sufficiency, causal reasoning
