Abstract

The analysis of financial markets has long been a cornerstone of economic research, impacting investors, policymakers, and researchers. As global financial systems grow in complexity, advanced analytical techniques to decode market behavior are increasingly critical. Spectral analysis, including methodologies like the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT), and Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), offers powerful tools for revealing underlying patterns in financial time series data. This thesis utilizes spectral techniques to enhance financial market analysis, focusing on the S&P 500 index—a key global economic benchmark. Objectives include refining and implementing FFT, STFT, and CWT tailored to financial data, extracting significant cyclical patterns and volatility dynamics, benchmarking findings against existing literature, and exploring practical applications in real-world financial analysis, trading strategies, and risk management. The thesis systematically builds the case for spectral analysis in financial markets, from theoretical foundations to practical applications. It includes an introduction, literature review, detailed methodologies for FFT, STFT, and CWT, practical application to the S&P 500, critical analysis of results, and a conclusion summarizing key findings and implications. Spectral analysis techniques provide significant advantages, offering a multi-dimensional view of market behavior and improving the ability to forecast trends, identify trading opportunities, and manage
risks. By focusing on the S&P 500 index, this study demonstrates the broader applicability of spectral analysis, leading to more informed decision-making and robust financial models.
