Abstract

This paper examines the reliability of self-reported accuracy in AI models within finance and accounting research and proposes methods to reduce the confidence gap, the discrepancy between a model’s actual accuracy and its self-reported confidence. Researchers in these fields often use self-reported accuracy to construct empirical proxies, yet experiments on financial sentiment analysis reveal a substantial confidence gap of up to 43%. I propose alternative prompting strategies that cut this gap by half and demonstrate that fine-tuned models largely eliminate the issue. Moreover, fine-tuning smaller non-generative models proves to be both resource-efficient and comparably effective to more advanced generative models.

Keywords: large language models, finetuning, prompting, chatgpt, roberta, finbert, overconfidence, confidence scores, measurement, research methodology
