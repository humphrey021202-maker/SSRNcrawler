Abstract

In a large sample setting, we compare four broadly available industry classification schemes in their effectiveness to group stocks with similar operating characteristics. We demonstrate the advantage of the Global Industry Classification Scheme to be consistent across different application schemes common to capital market research and across different groups of firms.

Keywords: Industry classification, homogeneity, performance, SIC, NAICS, FF, GICS

JEL Classification: C15, G1
