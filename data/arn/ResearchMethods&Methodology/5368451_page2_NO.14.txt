Abstract

The possibilistic view of information and uncertainty, rooted in fuzzy set theory and possibility theory, is distinct from the probabilistic view adopted by economics-based accounting research. Fuzzy set and possibility theories provide a versatile framework for modeling situations where uncertainty arises from vague boundaries of natural language. We discuss two potential applications to accounting research: (i) comparing information structures with linguistic imprecision and (ii) measuring the uncertainty and relative information arising from linguistic imprecision in financial disclosures. 

Keywords: Fuzzy Set Theory, Possibility Theory, Informativeness, Discourse Uncertainty, Entropy
