Abstract

This study examines whether ambiguous enforcement threats can enhance tax compliance more effectively than explicit deterrents. Challenging traditional economic deterrence models, we investigate the cognitive and emotional mechanisms through which enforcement uncertainty shapes taxpayer behavior. Across four experiments, including a large-scale field study (n = 204,936) with the UK tax authority, we provide causal evidence that non-specific enforcement messages increase tax payment rates by up to five percentage points, whereas explicit deterrent messages detailing financial and cognitive costs yield no significant effect. We document how enforcement uncertainty operates through two interconnected pathways. First, when taxpayers face enforcement uncertainty, they “fill in the blanks” by assuming severe potential penalties, reflecting uncertainty-driven caution. Resolving uncertainty by explicitly disclosing penalties paradoxically reduces compliance by eliminating worst-case scenarios. Second, physiological measurements (eye-tracking and pupillometry) reveal emotional stress responses triggered by uncertainty, highlighting an affective component to uncertainty aversion. In contrast, explicitly disclosed penalties can increase compliance when they exceed taxpayer expectations, suggesting that cognitive (belief-updating) responses depend critically on taxpayers’ prior beliefs. These findings provide evidence-based insights for enforcement authorities, demonstrating that strategic uncertainty can enhance compliance while maintaining regulatory discretion. For optimal enforcement design, authorities should carefully calibrate ambiguity levels, balancing the compliance benefits of uncertainty with the potentially higher effectiveness of credible explicit maximum penalties.
