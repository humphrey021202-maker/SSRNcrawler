Abstract

In financial communications, managers frequently attempt to persuade investors and other market participants to interpret information in a particular way. This study explores managers’ vocal persuasion in corporate disclosure using a multi-method research design. Using an experiment, we examine how managers vary their vocal cues when persuading investors to action or to inaction. We find that managers use lower and less variable voice pitch when attempting to persuade current investors to maintain their investment than when persuading prospective investors to invest. Archival audio analyses of earnings conference call recordings show that analysts are less likely to downgrade their stock recommendations when managers use a lower voice pitch to deliver bad news, suggesting that their vocal delivery affects how disclosures are received. Finally, semi-structured interviews with Investor Relations Officers provide additional context for our findings, and document concerns about vocal cues in disclosure and the methods used to manage them.

Keywords: firm disclosures, voluntary disclosure, reporting objectives, persuasion, vocal characteristics
