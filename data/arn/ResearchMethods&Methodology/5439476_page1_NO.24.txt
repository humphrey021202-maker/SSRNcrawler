Abstract

This study explores the future of sustainability accounting in Bangladesh by proposing a conceptual framework that integrates financial and non-financial reporting.

This paper reviews existing reporting practices, highlights problems of standardization, and proposes a conceptual framework for integrating sustainability information with financial reporting in Bangladesh. The aim is to show how sustainability accounting can improve transparency, investor confidence, and long-term business value.

Keywords: Sustainability Accounting, Full Disclosure, Financial Reporting
