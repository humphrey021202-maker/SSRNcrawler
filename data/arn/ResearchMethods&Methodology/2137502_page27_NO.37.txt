Abstract

In this paper we derive an easily computed approximation of Rogers and Shi’s lower bound for a local volatility jump-diffusion model and then use it to approximate European basket option values. If the local volatility function is time independent then there is a closed-form expression for the approximation. Numerical tests show that the lower bound approximation is fast and accurate in comparison with the Monte Carlo method, the partial-exact approximation method and the asymptotic expansion method.

Keywords: basket options valuation, local volatility jump-diffusion model, lower bound approximation, second order asymptotic expansion

JEL Classification: G13
