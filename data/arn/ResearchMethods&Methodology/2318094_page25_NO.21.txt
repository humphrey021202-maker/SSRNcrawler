Abstract

This paper examines how investors react to CEOs’ personal use of social media and how these reactions affect firm valuation. We theorize two mechanisms: a corporate communication channel, in which work-related tweets enhance transparency and increase firm value, and a CEO distraction channel, in which non-work-related tweets reduce value by signaling distraction or self-promotion. Using a panel of S&P 1500 firms from 2006–2020, covering 248 CEOs and over 250,000 tweets, we find that Tobin’s Q rises with work-related tweeting volume but falls with non-work-related tweeting volume. These effects are moderated by information environment, CEO celebrity, and investor horizons. A supplementary survey of professional investors corroborates these mechanisms. Our results highlight social media’s dual role as both a communication tool and an agency cost.

Keywords: CEOs, Social media, Firm Valuation, Corporate Communication, Executive Attention
