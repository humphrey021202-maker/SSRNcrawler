Abstract

In the face of economic uncertainty, Zambia's Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) face significant challenges that threaten their long-term viability and growth. This paper investigates long-term financial solutions tailored to these businesses' specific needs during turbulent economic times. It looks at how innovative financing mechanisms like microfinance, impact investing, and public-private partnerships can help MSMEs gain access to capital. Furthermore, it emphasizes the importance of financial literacy and capacity building in enabling entrepreneurs to effectively navigate economic fluctuations. The analysis uses case studies and empirical data to demonstrate effective strategies used by MSMEs in Zambia and other comparable economies. Finally, this study aims to provide a comprehensive framework for policymakers and stakeholders to foster resilience.
