Abstract

The impact of the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent reforms on banks' financial reports has primarily been assessed through quantitative measures and financial ratios. This study introduces a complementary approach, employing Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling to analyze textual data from the financial reports of 30 major financial institutions between 2005 and 2018. The findings indicate that following the crisis European banks increased their focus on capital requirements and reduced their focus on market risk, unlike their American counterparts. However, during the Basel III period, both American and European banks experienced a significant decline in market risk, accompanied by an increased focus on policies, controls, and capital requirements. Evidence of a significant increase in capital requirements disclosure was also found in Canadian and Australian banks during the Basel III implementation phase.
