Abstract

Pre-treatment trends threaten inferences in difference-in-differences (DiD) regressions, which have become ubiquitous in accounting research. We survey recent studies in accounting employing DiD, finding that many use short pre-treatment windows and test few parameters for evidence of pre-treatment trends. Using both simulated data and actual “shocks” employed in the literature, we show that this approach has low power and significantly increases the risk of reporting biased treatment effects. We evaluate various strategies to both identify and control for pre-treatment trends, which we find significantly affects inferences in common accounting settings.

Keywords: difference-in-differences, causal inference in accounting, pre-treatment trends, statistical power
