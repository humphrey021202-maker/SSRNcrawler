Abstract

In a world overwhelmed by information and noise, the power to ask the right questions becomes the foundation of meaningful action and innovation. The 5W2H model, developed through personal experience and observation, introduces a structured thinking framework that goes beyond traditional research methods. This model integrates seven core questions-Who, What, Where, When, Why, How, and Humanity-to create a practical roadmap for individual clarity, startup success, and social impact. This working paper outlines the model, its application in various domains (entrepreneurship, education, content creation), and how it empowers individuals to move from chaos to clarity. The inclusion of 'Humanity' as the 7th dimension distinguishes this model from classical 5W1H structures, aligning strategic thinking with ethical and human-centered decision-making.
