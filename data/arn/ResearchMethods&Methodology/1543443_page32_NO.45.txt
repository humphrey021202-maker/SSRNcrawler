Abstract

Auditors’ switching is commonly examined based on statistical techniques such as discriminant analysis or logit and probit specifications. This paper employs two dichotomous statistical techniques to show both whether auditors’ switching can be forecasted and which method is better fitted for the task. In Greece, the phenomenon is recent and research findings indicate that models fit better depending on the data. Essentially, auditors’ switching can be forecasted and the most differentiating variables between groups of classification are Market Value of Equity/Book Value of Total Debt.

JEL Classification: M40, M41, M41
