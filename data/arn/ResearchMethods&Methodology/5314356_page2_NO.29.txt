Abstract

This study examines whether retail investor communications can discipline corporate misbehavior. We conducted a field experiment targeting U.S. publicly listed firms exhibiting substantial discretionary accruals, alleging excessive earnings management through private investor relations (IR) emails and public social media posts. Firms receiving private email communications significantly reduced earnings management compared to the control group. Conversely, public social media communications alone had no significant treatment impact. Intriguingly, explicitly referencing social media posts within private emails significantly amplified the treatment effect. These findings underscore the governance potential of retail investors and challenge the traditional view that corporate oversight is the exclusive domain of institutional investors and blockholders.

Keywords: corporate misconduct, corporate governance, field experiment, investor relations, social media, Earnings management, Corporate social responsbility

Ethics Approval

We obtained human ethics approval from our university to conduct the experimental exercise in this project (Ref. no. EC085/2021).
