Abstract

This article draws on my experiences conducting field research utilizing archival company data and provides a roadmap for such projects. Specifically, I provide an overview of the main stages typically involved in a field study utilizing archival company data: finding a suitable research site; visiting the research site; receiving the data; processing the data; and completing the research project. In so doing, I highlight many of the opportunities as well as challenges involved in such projects. My hope is that sharing my experiences will prove useful for other researchers embarking on, or considering, field research of this nature.

Keywords: Field research; field studies; archival data
