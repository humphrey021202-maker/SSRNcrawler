Abstract

This paper explores implications of client-driven AI sophistication, auditor AI investments, and uncertainty about PCAOB guidance on the audit risk model. Our findings show that when the PCAOB provides clear, stable standards for AI use, auditors and clients reach more efficient equilibria. Under these conditions, auditors invest appropriately in AI-driven tools, and clients confidently adopt more sophisticated AI reporting systems without facing disproportionate audit costs. Conversely, vague or evolving PCAOB guidance distorts equilibrium incentives, leading auditors to over- or under-invest in AI and clients to limit AI sophistication, missing potential control improvements. These results highlight that regulatory clarity is not a mere administrative detail: it directly enhances alignment between auditors’ and clients’ strategic choices, reducing excessive expenditure and improving overall audit quality. By offering an analytical framework and feasibility conditions, this research provides a valuable theoretical benchmark for policymakers, auditors, and clients navigating emerging technologies in a dynamic regulatory landscape.
