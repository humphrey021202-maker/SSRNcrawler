Field Research Methods in Management Accounting

Abstract

Field research has a very long history of application in many disciplines including anthropology, sociology and business. Field research differs significantly from other research methods in that trained researchers document the interactions of people as they live and work in naturally occurring settings. These characteristics make field research one of the most challenging forms of social science investigation to master. In the history of management accounting research, there have been some noteworthy field studies (cf. Simon et al. 1954; Hopwood 1972), however, prior to the early 1980s, field studies comprised less than 5 percent of published research.

JEL Classification: M40, M46
