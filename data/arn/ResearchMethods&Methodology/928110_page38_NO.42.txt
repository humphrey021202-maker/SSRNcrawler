Abstract

This is a PDF file of 'Facilitating Research with the Social Science Research Network: An Editor's Perspective' slides from a presentation at the Financial Services Institute Symposium hosted by St. John's University on September 8, 2006 in Manhattan, New York.

The purpose of this presentation on the Social Science Research Network (SSRN) is to provide faculty and business professionals an initial overview of the research services and features of the SSRN eLibrary at www.ssrn.com. As an Editor and Subscriber of SSRN, Professor Ricciardi shares his insights concerning SSRN with conference attendees from a research, editorial, and teaching perspective.

This presentation covers six main issues:

 What is an introductory resource for learning about the Social Science Research Network (SSRN)?

 What is the Social Science Research Network (SSRN)?

 What are some important aspects of SSRN for understanding and utilizing the SSRN website?

 What are some key tips for authors submitting a working paper or accepted paper abstract for distribution within a SSRN eJournal?

 What is my perspective as an Editor for the SSRN eJournals in Behavioral/ Experimental Finance, Economics & Accounting?

 What are some basic SSRN tools for facilitating your research agenda?

Note: SSRN is experimenting with enabling the distribution of different types of files: slides, spreadsheets, video, etc. This is an upload of a PDF file of PowerPoint slides. We are interested in our users desires to distribute files that go beyond word processing text files. You can communicate with me on these issues via my email address below. We invite you to submit your own presentation slides.
