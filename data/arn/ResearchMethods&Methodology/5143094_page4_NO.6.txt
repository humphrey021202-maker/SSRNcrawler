Abstract

The transparency of annual reports is crucial for stakeholders; however, the textual information presented in these reports often exhibits varying degrees of vagueness. This study introduces a novel measure of textual vagueness that combines linguistic vagueness theory with advanced machine learning to measure the annual report vagueness, and test if it can serve as a predictive tool for preventing supply chain risks. By using data from publicly listed firms in China, we find a significant positive correlation between annual report vagueness and the subsequent period’s supply chain volatility and the instability of both customers and suppliers. Mechanism analyses reveal three pathways through which vague disclosures can indicate declining asset quality, corporate misconduct, and unexpected negative earnings surprises. Moreover, heterogeneity analyses show that these effects are especially pronounced in weaker marketization regions and lower media scrutiny. These findings can aid for business partners in mitigating ethical risks and optimizing resource allocation.

Keywords: Annual report vagueness, Supply chain risk, Language risk signal, Textual analysis
