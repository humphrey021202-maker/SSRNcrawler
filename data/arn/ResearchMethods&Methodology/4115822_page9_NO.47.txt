Abstract

This essay advances the possibly startling notion that as a matter of largely conceptual understanding, the vast majority of accounting research’s empirical efforts concern tests of null hypotheses that are, a priori, false. Figuratively speaking, our journals specialize in providing compelling evidence that ‘the earth is not flat’. It further presents thoughts on the causes and consequences of this state of affairs. Moreover, while other fields also suffer from this ‘flat earth’ condition, it argues that as a field that specializes in issues surrounding the conveyance of useful information, the accounting academy should step up and take leadership on dealing with the problem. The essay closes by discussing how the field might venture forth from this sheltered approach to empirical inference and thereby enhance the discovery content of its empirical inquiries.

Keywords: NHST, Methodology, Statistical Inference, Accounting Research Quality
