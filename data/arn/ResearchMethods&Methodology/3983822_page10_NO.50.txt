Abstract

In October 2018, IBES claimed to have anonymized the identifications (IDs) of 88 brokers and their analysts in its Detail History Files. This paper examines to what extent the change affects the post-2018 Detail History File. The main findings are as follows. First, there is no evidence of a large-scale ID anonymization for the annual and quarterly EPS forecasts for U.S. firms. Second, the anonymization predominantly affects the forecasts of non-U.S. firms. A significant percentage of forecasts for non-U.S. firms have been anonymized since January 2017 (at least a year earlier than what was claimed). Third, there is no evidence of a large-scale ID reshuffling of forecasts between the 2015 and 2021 Detail History Files. Last, because the anonymization has very little effect on the Recommendations Detail File, I am able to offer detailed steps to reverse-engineer the anonymized analyst IDs in the Unadjusted Detail History File.

Keywords: Analysts, IBES, anonymization, reshuffling, forecasts, recommendations.

JEL Classification: G00, M41
