Abstract

We examine the usefulness of robust regression estimators as a tool for improving estimation precision in archival research. OLS estimates can be noisy, and confidence intervals too wide, when basic assumptions about regression errors are violated. Such violations frequently occur in archival research due to the long tails in the distributions of dependent variables, even after applying standard outlier treatments. Using simulated and actual research settings, we show how robust regression estimators increase the precision of coefficient estimates, improve test power, and tighten confidence intervals. At the same time, robust estimators are sensitive to design choices and they transform the sample based on which inferences are drawn. Finally, we discuss how to combine robust regression estimators with fixed effects and present alternatives to a commonly used, but biased, approach to compute clustered standard errors for robust estimators.
