Abstract

This article describes a cost analysis of an employment programme available to people claiming incapacity benefits in the UK. The NDDP was delivered locally by contracted providers called ‘job brokers’. The cost analysis found great variation among job brokers’ costs and profitability, much of which seems attributable to differences in Job Broker size. The methods described here will be useful in evaluations whenever multiple institutions are contracted by governments to deliver services, especially when these institutions are involved in several different programmes.

Keywords: cost analysis, cost-benefit analysis, incapacity benefits

JEL Classification: D61, I38
