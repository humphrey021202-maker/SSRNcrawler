Abstract

This paper re-examines the earnings-returns relation in a framework that unifies the cross section and time series. While prior studies argue that earnings become less important for asset prices, they rely on cross-sectional analyses while ignoring time-series considerations. In contrast, time-series analyses indicate that the firm-level earnings-returns relation has not declined. When including both firm and aggregate earnings in a rolling-window panel setting, firm earnings exhibit a declining coefficient whereas aggregate earnings exhibit an increasing trend (switching from negative to positive). These trends are explained by an increase in firm connectedness and a decline in the predictability of aggregate earnings.

Keywords: firm-specific earnings, market-wide aggregate earnings, firm stock returns, earnings response coefficient, production network, input-output, earnings timeliness predictability

JEL Classification: D57, G14, L14, L25, M41
