Abstract

This paper proposes three modifications to the augmented regression method (ARM) for bias-reduced estimation and statistical inference in the predictive regression. They are related to improved bias-correction, stationarity-correction, and matrix formulae for bias-correction and covariance matrix estimation. The improved ARM provides predictive coefficient estimators unbiased to the order of n-1; and overcomes the difficulty which arises when bias-correction renders the model non-stationary. By using the matrix formulae, the improved ARM can easily be implemented for a high order or multivariate predictive regression. From a Monte Carlo experiment, it is found that these modifications deliver substantial gain in small samples, in terms of smaller bias in the estimation of predictive coefficients and improved size properties of the associated statistical tests. As an application, the improved ARM is applied to monthly US stock return data to evaluate the predictive power of dividend yield in univariate and bivariate predictive regressions. It is found that the dividend yield shows statistically significant predictability for stock return from 1946 to 1994. However, it shows little predictive power if the data from 1995 to 2009 is used. These results are evident when the lag order of predictive regression is set to 1 or 4.

Keywords: Bias-correction, Financial ratios, Return predictability, Stationarity-correction
