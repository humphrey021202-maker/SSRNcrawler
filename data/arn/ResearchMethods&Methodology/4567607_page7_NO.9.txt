Abstract

This research addresses the challenge of extracting financial data from unstructured sources, a persistent issue for accounting researchers, investors, and regulators. Leveraging large language models (LLMs), this study introduces a novel framework for automated financial data extraction from PDF-formatted files. Following a design science methodology, this research develops the framework through a combination of text mining and prompt engineering techniques. The framework is subsequently applied to analyze governmental annual reports and corporate ESG reports, which are presented in PDF format. Test results indicate that the framework achieves an average 99.5% accuracy rate in a notably short time span when extracting key financial indicators. A subsequent large out-of-sample test reveals an overall accuracy rate converging around 96%. This study contributes to the evolving literature on applying LLMs in accounting and offers a valuable tool for both academic and industrial applications.
