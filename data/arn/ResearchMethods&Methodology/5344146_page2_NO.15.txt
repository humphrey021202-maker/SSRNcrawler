Abstract

This study explores the influence of students' social attributes on their mathematics performance at Arcelo Memorial National High School to identify interventions for improving academic outcomes. Employing a descriptive correlational research design, 243 students were selected through systematic random sampling, guided by Slovin's formula. Data were gathered using a social attributes checklist and students' second-quarter mathematics grades. Analytical tools included percentage, frequency count, weighted mean, and Pearson's r. Results showed that most students were 13 years old, with an almost equal number of males and females. The majority of their parents were high school graduates, and most families earned a monthly income of Php10, 000 or below. Students' grades predominantly indicated an approaching proficiency level. Social attributes findings revealed neutral perceptions of individual attributes and positive perceptions of social skills and peer relationships. The study concluded that mathematics performance was significantly influenced by social skills and peer relationships, while individual attributes had no direct effect. However, developing individual attributes could enhance social skills and peer relationships. Teachers are encouraged to implement the proposed action plan to improve student performance in mathematics. Further research on this topic is recommended to deepen understanding and support evidence-based strategies.

Keywords: teaching mathematics, social attributes, mathematics performance, descriptivecorrelational design, Philippines
