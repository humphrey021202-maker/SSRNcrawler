Abstract

This paper investigates whether publicly funded programs allocate resources toward overhead expenses exceeding permissible limits, potentially undermining their core missions. Specifically, we examine this issue within the U.S. organ procurement market, where Medicare’s transplant reimbursement system may inadvertently incentivize organ procurement organizations (OPOs) to disproportionately allocate funding to Kidney’s overhead rather than other organs. Utilizing comprehensive financial data from 51 independent OPOs covering the period from 2015 to 2021, we explore cost allocation behaviors across the four most demanded organs—kidneys, livers, hearts, and lungs. We apply variance decomposition and Oaxaca–Blinder decomposition techniques to identify patterns of cost-shifting influenced by different reimbursement methods. Our findings reveal significant unexplained overhead variances associated with kidney procurements, indicating strategic cost-shifting from other organs to maximize Medicare reimbursements. The analysis demonstrates that overhead expenses contribute substantially more to the variation in kidney procurement costs compared to other organs, highlighting potential inefficiencies and regulatory vulnerabilities within the current system. These results underscore the need for greater financial transparency and more rigorous oversight within publicly funded healthcare programs. Our study contributes methodologically and empirically to healthcare economics literature, providing valuable insights for policymakers seeking to enhance efficiency, accountability, and equity in resource allocation within the vital U.S. organ transplantation system.

Keywords: Organ Procurement Organizations, Cost Allocation, Medicare Reimbursement, Healthcare Accounting, Cost-Shifting
