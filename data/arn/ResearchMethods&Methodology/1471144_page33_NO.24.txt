Abstract

This paper develops a novel, intertemporal approach to assessing income risk exposures. The model illustrates how factors such as risk horizon, trading frequency and portfolio composition affect risk exposures stemming from different components of Comprehensive Income. Applied to patterns of unrealized Fair Value changes in US bank Available-for-Sale portfolios, the model significantly improves on the most widely accepted convention for multiperiod risk aggregation (the so called square root of t or ‘sqrt(t)’ rule). The model’s findings have direct application to Value-at-Risk and stress test methods used to assess financial institution risk. From a financial reporting standpoint, the proposed framework affirms the utility of the ‘mixed measurement’ accounting model, and supports multifaceted or ‘dual presentation’ approaches to financial statements.

Keywords: Risk, Financial Statement Presentation, Fair Value

JEL Classification: M40
