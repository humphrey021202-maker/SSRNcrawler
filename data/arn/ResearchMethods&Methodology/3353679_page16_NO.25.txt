Abstract

This paper proposes an arbitrary high order weak approximation scheme for multidimensional Stratonovich stochastic differential equations using Malliavin calculus. The scheme efficiently works whether test function is smooth or not. The Malliavin Monte Carlo method, a simple numerical algorithm, is introduced to implement the scheme. Numerical examples illustrate the validity of the method.

Keywords: stochastic differential equation, weak approximation, Malliavin calculus, Monte Carlo simulation
