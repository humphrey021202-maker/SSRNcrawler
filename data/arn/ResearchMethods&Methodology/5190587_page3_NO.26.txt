Abstract

Building on Lindsay and other research, we provide a comprehensive overview of the problems with the Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST) paradigm. We then discuss alternative approaches that researchers can use and offer guidance to future researchers in this area. More specifically, this paper highlights that the long-standing overemphasis on p-values in NHST is problematic as it leads to misinterpretations of statistical significance, encourages p-hacking, and overlooks the practical significance and effect sizes of research findings. The paper by Lindsay advances our understanding of NHST paradigm and provides a strong case for the abandonment of the NHST paradigm. The author emphasizes the significant presence of model uncertainty and low statistical power in the management accounting and control (MAC) field to further support the case for discarding the traditional NHST approach. Lindsay's work enhances our comprehension of the deep-rooted flaws within the NHST paradigm, as it hinders meaningful progress in research. We aim to contribute to the ongoing debate surrounding the NHST paradigm by outlining various reasons it can be considered problematic and by offering alternative approaches.
