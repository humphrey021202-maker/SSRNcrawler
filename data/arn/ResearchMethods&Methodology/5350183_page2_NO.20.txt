Abstract

Entrepreneurs in emerging economies often struggle to access traditional forms of capital due to weak financial infrastructure, limited venture capital, and restrictive banking systems. In recent years, cryptocurrencies have emerged as alternative financial instruments offering borderless, decentralized, and potentially inclusive ways to raise capital. This study explores the viability of cryptocurrencies specifically Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) platforms as mechanisms for entrepreneurial finance in underbanked and developing markets. Using a mixed-methods approach, this research integrates a quantitative survey of 200 entrepreneurs in Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia with qualitative case studies of six startups that have utilized cryptocurrency-based funding models. The paper investigates key opportunities presented by cryptocurrencies, such as global investor access, lower transaction costs, and independence from traditional financial systems. Simultaneously, it evaluates critical risks including volatility, fraud, technological barriers, and regulatory uncertainty. Data analysis reveals high entrepreneurial interest in crypto-based financing but also a clear need for supportive legal frameworks and improved financial literacy. This study contributes to the growing literature on fintech and entrepreneurship by offering a conceptual model that highlights the drivers, barriers, and moderating conditions affecting cryptocurrency adoption. The paper concludes with policy implications and directions for future empirical research, aiming to bridge the knowledge gap between technological innovation and sustainable development in emerging economies.
