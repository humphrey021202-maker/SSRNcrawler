Abstract

This study examines the spillover effects of dividend payout policy on earnings management by utilizing a natural experiment in Korea. From 2015 to 2017, the Korean government implemented a temporary tax reform that reduced the tax burden on dividends for firms exceeding specific thresholds for dividend payout ratio and dividend yield. Using a difference-in-differences design, the results suggest that tax-eligible firms significantly decreased discretionary accruals during the reform period. Further analysis reveals an increase in discretionary accruals after the tax reform was abolished. The study offers important policy implications regarding the unintended consequences of corporate payout regulations.

Keywords: Payout policy, dividend, Tax Reform, dividend income tax, Earnings Management, discretionary accruals
