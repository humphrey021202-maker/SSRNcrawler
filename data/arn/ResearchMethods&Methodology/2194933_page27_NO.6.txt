Abstract

I document evidence that short-horizon earnings mean reversion is the initial portion of a long-horizon cycle in firm earnings, and motivate a theory for how industry level capital expenditure forms a delayed negative feedback loop around firm earnings, driving the cycle. Regression results detect a relationship between the time to build capacity, measured in previous research, and the length of earnings cycles that I measure using Fourier transforms of aggregate industry earnings changes. Additionally, I find that specific delays of industry-level capacity expansion are a significant determinant of future firm-level earnings.

Keywords: earnings mean reversion, earnings cycles, feedback loop, time-to-build capacity
