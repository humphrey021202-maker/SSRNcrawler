Abstract

Future revenue estimates are an important building block in fundamental equity valuation models, yet there is limited evidence on the information that can contribute to better revenue forecasts. We produce new evidence that changes in consumers' opinions on corporate brand performance are useful in predicting corporate revenues. We also find that when consumer opinion data is available, analysts' revenue forecasts are more accurate, after controlling for differences between firms with and without brand data coverage. Our results suggest that revenue forecasts can be improved by using consumer opinion data.

Keywords: Financial analysts, brands, revenue forecasts, alternative data, branding

JEL Classification: M41, M37
