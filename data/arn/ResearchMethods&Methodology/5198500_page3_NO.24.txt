Abstract

Using cross-sectional stock prices and a parsimonious set of fundamental variables, we employ the Ohlson (1999) model to identify the price wedge shock (WS), which measures deviation between observed stock price and the present value of expected future dividends. Empirical evidence suggests that WS captures novel mispricing information not fully accounted for in prior literature. The return spread for the hedge portfolio, which is long in the highest WS quintile and short in the lowest WS quintile, ranges from 0.53% to 1.20% per month and remains robust after controlling for well-documented risk factors. This positive relation cannot be explained by common cross-sectional characteristics. Furthermore, the impact of WS is stronger among stocks with greater limits to arbitrage and during high-sentiment periods.

Keywords: Mispricing, Price wedge, Asset pricing, Dividend discount model
