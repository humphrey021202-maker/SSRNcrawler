Abstract

The paper discusses and examines the presence of microeconometrics in contemporary accounting research. We begin by highlighting questions and dilemmas concerning the direction of accounting research as they appear in current academic debates. Quantitative methodology in accounting utilizes econometrics, particularly microeconometrics. Our analysis shows that approximately two-thirds of publications in leading journals, as well as submissions to the SSRN Accounting Research Network employ econometric methods, specifically within the field of financial microeconometrics. The papers reviewed in two surveys typically use panel econometrics methods, methods of causal microeconometrics and qualitative variables modelling.

Keywords: econometrics, accounting, financial microeconometrics, applied accounting
