Abstract

This paper presents a thought experiment utilizing a large language model (DeepSeek-v3) to simulate a full academic peer-review process for a hypothetical proof of the Riemann Hypothesis. We task the AI to first generate a novel, interdisciplinary proof strategy involving the Fargues-Fontaine curve, Shimura varieties, and a twisted Dirac operator. Subsequently, we prompt the AI to adopt the personas of critical peer reviewers to analyze the proposed proof. The simulation results in a rigorous critique, identifying fatal flaws such as undefined central objects and circular logic. Notably, the AI then synthesizes this criticism to reframe the failed proof into a credible long-term research program. This exercise demonstrates the potential of AI as a tool for conceptual stress-testing and generating academically rigorous discourse within scientific research.
