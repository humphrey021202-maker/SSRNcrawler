Abstract

This paper explores the use of ranking lists as a performance management tool and examines their possible consequences for accounting research. So far, the consequences of using ranking lists have been explored in relation to top-ranked journals in accounting, leaving out lower-ranked journals. Based on this, we scrutinised five lower-ranked accounting journals from the Academic Journal Guide using qualitative content analysis. Our findings show that lower-ranked journals often use publishing practices like those in top-ranked journals, raising a concern that accounting research might become homogenous and exclude new and innovative research practices. However, the findings also indicate that lower-ranked journals implement differentiation strategies in their publishing practices, opening up the potential for new and innovative research practices. Overall, we conclude that the influence of journal ranking lists extends across the entire ranking spectrum, exerting power over journals regardless of their position.

Keywords: publish or perish, journal ranking, performance management, academic journal guide (AJG)
