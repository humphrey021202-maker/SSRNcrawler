Abstract

This paper aims to generalize linear models for the multiproduct break-even point. Taking into consideration identified research gaps, the paper focuses on deriving formulas for determining the multiproduct break-even point through determination models. Different assumptions regarding the constancy of individual product contribution structures to total physical production volume, total revenue, total variable costs, and total contribution margin are taken into account. Additionally, connections between the obtained solutions from different models and different assumptions regarding the constancy of individual product contributions are established. The verification of the optimality of solutions obtained through different determination models is conducted by comparing them with solutions derived from linear programming as a benchmark. The developed models are tested using a case study of a multiproduct company in the metal processing industry. Through comparative analysis, the hypotheses concerning obtaining an optimal solution and the identical nature of solutions derived from the determination model and linear programming are examined. This paper contributes to the understanding of the multiproduct break-even point, providing a theoretical and practical framework for evaluation and enabling the application of various determination models in the context of a multiproduct situation.
