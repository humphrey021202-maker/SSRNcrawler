Abstract

This note presents a result on the serial correlation of the score process of the predictive quantile regression with multi-horizon outcomes. The result indicates that inference of multi-horizon quantile (or median) regression is more robust to serial correlation induced by overlapping observations, than the standard multi-horizon mean regression. The finding is illustrated by stock return data.

Keywords: HAR inference; long horizons; overlapping observations; predictive regression; quantile regression

JEL Classification: C21, C22
