Abstract

It is often claimed that statistical studies of covariation between financial and stock market data can help set better financial reporting policy. Such covariation, even when it can be estimated, tells us little about which financial reports help make better financial decisions. A case in support of such claims remains to be made.

Keywords: financial reporting policy, efficient markets, statistical covariation

JEL Classification: M41
