Abstract

Cointegration analyses of macroeconomic time series are often not based on fully specified theoretical models. We use a theoretical model to scrutinize common procedures in applied cointegration analysis. Monte Carlo experiments show that (1) some tests of the cointegration vectors do not work well on series generated by an equilibrium business cycle model; (2) cointegration restrictions add little in forecasting; (3) structural VAR models based on weak long run restrictions seem to work well. The main disadvantages of cointegration analysis without strong links to economic theory are that it makes it hard to estimate and interpret the cointegration vectors.

Keywords: cointegration, money demand, common trends, equilibrium business cycle model

JEL Classification: C32, E32
