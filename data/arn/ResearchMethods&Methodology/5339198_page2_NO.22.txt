Abstract

We apply the Enhanced Volpatti Exact Solution (E–VES) framework to the classical problem of bounded Poiseuille flow, with the goal of identifying all structurally admissible stationary solutions to the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations in a finite planar channel. The E–VES methodology redefines admissibility as a variational principle: only velocity–pressure fields that minimize a global residual functional—while strictly satisfying incompressibility, no-slip boundaries, and full-system regularity—are considered physically valid.

Using a high-precision Galerkin solver and exact projection-based enforcement of all constraints, we systematically compute and classify flow configurations over a wide range of Reynolds numbers. The classical parabolic solution is found to be structurally inadmissible at all Re, with a persistent residual norm; even under refined modal resolutions. At the critical value, a bifurcated, non-parabolic solution emerges that fully satisfies the E–VES admissibility conditions, breaks midplane symmetry, and exhibits improved energetic efficiency.

These findings constitute the first rigorous detection of structural bifurcation in bounded Poiseuille flow and resolve the classical Sommerfeld paradox without invoking spectral instability. The E–VES framework demonstrates that transition is not necessarily linked to eigenvalue crossings, but can arise from a global reorganization of the admissible solution space—governed by geometry, boundary conditions, and system-wide constraints.

This work completes the structural classification of canonical shear flows under E–VES—including infinite Poiseuille (fully excluded), bounded Couette (dual admissibility), and bounded Poiseuille (exclusive bifurcation). It establishes structural admissibility as a physically grounded, mathematically rigorous criterion for flow classification, and opens the way to a general theory of transition based on variational selection rather than perturbative instability.
