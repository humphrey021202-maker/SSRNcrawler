Abstract

In this paper, we show numerically how to calculate the price of bond options, swaps, caps and floors for Levy one-factor stochastic interest rate models via partial integro-differential equations (PIDE). These models include, in particular, Ornshtein-Uhlenbeck (1930), Vasicek (1977), Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (1985), continuous-time GARCH, Ho-Lee (1986) and Hull-White (1990) models. We use Matache et al (2006) approach to solve numerically the PIDEs.

Keywords: Levy-based interest rate models, bond options, swaps, caps, floors, PIDEs, numerical solutions

JEL Classification: C36
