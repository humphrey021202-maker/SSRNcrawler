Abstract

The social sciences are widely concerned with the integrity of data analyses in empirical studies, Retraction scandals and replication failures suggest that researchers substantively engage in dubious data analytic practices like p-hacking and HARKing to confirm their theoretical propositions. In this paper, we offer an alternative, less accusatory, analysis of the problem, focusing on the area of survey-based managerial accounting research. We demonstrate how theoretical degrees of freedom support retrofitting theory to data, without any need for researchers to engage in dubious data analytic practices. We hope this offers a more subtle yet under-researched alternative view on replication failures within the management accounting domain. Using existing and published survey data we show almost infinite theory retrofitting opportunities under generally accepted analytic accounting practices (GAAAP), given the availability of alternative theories of management accounting. We complement this analysis with a simulation based on 1,000 randomly generated datasets, arguing for the generic nature of the underlying theoretical issue we identify. We conclude this paper by discussing the theoretical and methodological implications for survey-based management accounting research.

Keywords: survey-based research, questionable research practices, theory development, management accounting, simulation analysis
