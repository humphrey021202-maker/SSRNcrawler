Abstract

I assess the sensitivity of results in Breuer (2021, 2025) to sample and design choices. I find that sample and design choices have non-negligible impacts on the sign, magnitude, and statistical significance of individual coefficient estimates. The broader inferences in Breuer (2021, 2025), however, appear reasonably robust. Pooling information across thousands of model variants and various proxies, I continue to find evidence that reporting mandates appear to foster ownership dispersion in capital markets and competition in product markets but, importantly, do not appear to unambiguously improve the efficiency of industry-wide resource allocation. With respect to auditing mandates, I continue to primarily find evidence that they impose an operating cost, deterring some firms from entering. Although these inferences are broadly in line with Breuer (2021, 2025), they are more uncertain than implied by individual estimates in Breuer (2021, 2025), as illustrated by the sensitivities in this note. Interestingly, some of the sensitivities appear to reflect systematic heterogeneity in the effects of financial-reporting mandates across countries, industries, or time periods. This heterogeneity calls for continued research on the mandates' impacts in various contexts and circumstances.

Keywords: Reporting, Auditing, Regulation, Replication, Sensitivities
