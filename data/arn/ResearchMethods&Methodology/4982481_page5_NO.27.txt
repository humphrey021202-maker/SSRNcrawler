Abstract

In this study, we develop a new measure of accounting quality based on real-transaction online sales data from a leading B2C e-commerce platform. Our exploration into the catalysts for online sales reveals the degree to which a firm’s share of online sales over total sales is influenced by industry peer pressure and their readiness to embrace e-commerce. With these insights, we develop a model and project firms' reported sales onto online sales to derive a discretionary sales metric. We find that firms with an elevated level of discretionary sales demonstrate lower sales persistence and are more likely than those with a lower level of discretionary sales to witness an uptick in accounts receivable, restate their financial reports, and incur high audit fees. Overall, our evidence suggests that online sales contain significant information about firms’ fundamentals and reporting quality.

Keywords: Accounting quality, Online sales, Transaction data, E-commerce
