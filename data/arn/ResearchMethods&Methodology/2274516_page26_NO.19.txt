Abstract

We examine the F score in global emerging markets and show there is a meaningful premium attached to high F score stocks which is unrelated to the size, value and momentum premiums. It is larger for high value stocks, moderately higher for high momentum stocks and unrelated to stock size. This suggests the usual explanation for the power of the F score – investor neglect of high F score stocks – is incomplete because big cap and high momentum stocks are typically not neglected. We conjecture another factor shaping the premium to high F score stocks is the confirmation bias.

Keywords: F score, financial strength, emerging markets

JEL Classification: G11, G12, G14, G15, G17
