Abstract

This paper discuss linear regression analysis applied on cross sections, on time-series, and on panel data. It also cover topics such as heteroscedastic errors, serially correlated errors with HC and HAC covariance matrices. For panel regressions it covers one- and two-way models, fixed effect, pooled and random effects model. The section on panel regressions also covers HC and HAC covariance matrices. Along with the discussion I implement the discussion in this paper using R on accounting and stock market data.

Keywords: regression analys, panel regressions, robust covariance matrix, panel regression, accounting, finance
