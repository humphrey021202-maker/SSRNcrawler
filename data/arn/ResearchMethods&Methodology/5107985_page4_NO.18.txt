Abstract

Compustat is a widely used database in accounting and finance research. Its common products, such as the Annual and Quarterly files, are regularly adjusted by Compustat over time to standardize the financial statements. While these re-adjustments allow for comparability of financial statements across firms and time, they also pose significant challenges for replicating prior research and introduce look-ahead bias. Using Compustat Snapshot, which preserves data as they existed at each point in time, we find that ongoing adjustments significantly alter key financial items such as sales and earnings, leading to material differences depending on when the data are accessed. We also find that earnings response coefficients, accrual-based hedge portfolio returns, and correlations between accruals and cash flows differ substantially depending on when the data are accessed, suggesting that precise replication of prior studies using common Compustat products is nearly impossible due to these ongoing adjustments.

Keywords: Financial Statement Data, Compustat, Adjustment, Standardization, Replicability, Look-ahead Bias
