Abstract

This study investigates impression management (IM) in sustainability reports of publicly traded companies on the Brazilian stock exchange's Corporate Sustainability Index (ISE-B3). It explores the use of graphs and potential correlations between companies' sustainability index prominence and graphical elements. Analyzing 2022 sustainability reports from 34 firms, we utilize the US-SEC's 'Plain English Handbook' to identify IM. Key findings reveal strategically crafted graphs presenting company-favorable information, using presentation enhancement techniques. Despite commonalities in graph features, a significant proportion of pie charts are divided into more than three parts, and material discrepancies favor the company's interests, confirming IM. Surprisingly, no observed association exists between a company's sustainability index weight and the presentation of materially distorted graphs, challenging the initial hypothesis. This study highlights potential biases in graph disclosure, advocating for regulatory measures and increased market supervision scrutiny. The findings emphasize transparency and accuracy's pivotal role in corporate communication for investors and stakeholders.

Keywords: Impression Management, Sustainability Reports, Graph, Corporate Sustainability Index, Environmental-Social-Governance (ESG), Brazilian Stock Exchange, ISE-B3, Relative Graph Discrepancy (RGD), Measurement distortion, Presentation Enhancement, Selectivity
