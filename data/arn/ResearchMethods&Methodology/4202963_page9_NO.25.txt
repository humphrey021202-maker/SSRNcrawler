Abstract

Thomson Reuters Asset4 (Asset4) is a leading corporate social responsibility (CSR) database often used by practitioners and researchers. This review offers a precise understanding of prior studies using Asset4 and their justification for selecting Asset4, and identifies research opportunities. We review 285 studies using Asset4 data published in quality academic journals, analysing: (1) the usage of Asset4 pillars, categories, data points, and indicators; (2) the justification of using Asset4; and (3) research themes. Our findings provide valuable information for practitioners and researchers who (plan to) use CSR databases, including our guidance on promising avenues for future studies. DOI: 10.1111/acfi.13004
