Abstract

The accounting literature includes numerous examples of discontinuities at prominent benchmarks that are widely interpreted as evidence that earnings are managed to meet those benchmarks. However, there are also a few examples where discontinuities do not exist, which are sometimes interpreted as inconsistent with earnings management. There are also several suggested alternative explanations for discontinuities. This paper reviews and integrates the various elements of the body of discontinuity-related evidence.

Keywords: earnings management, discontinuities

JEL Classification: G14, M40
