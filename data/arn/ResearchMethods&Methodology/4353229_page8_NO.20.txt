Abstract

The boundary n-gram (BnG) measure has been proposed in the accounting literature as an alternative measure for assessing textual similarity. Its adoption, however, could be a challenge because the original algorithm is somewhat inefficient. In this paper we design a new algorithm to improve computational efficiency. Based the benchmark study of a financial reports sample, the new algorithm is nearly 31 times faster.

Keywords: Cosine Similarity; Boundary n-Gram

JEL Classification: M41
