Abstract

Purpose-This study examines how R&D expenditure affects corporate profitability, with a particular focus on Sri Lankan listed companies in the industrial and service sectors. It seeks to ascertain whether R&D spending has a major effect on profitability metrics like return on equity (ROE) and return on assets (ROA). 



Design/Methodology/Approach-Twenty firms listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) were chosen through the use of a purposive sampling technique. A quantitative methodology based on secondary data from 2020 to 2025 is used in the study. After adjusting for company size, leverage, sales growth, and asset tangibility, descriptive statistics, correlation, and regression analyses were used to investigate the relationship between R&D expenditure and corporate profitability. 


Findings-The findings show that R&D investment and profitability metrics (ROA and ROE) have a favorable and statistically significant association. Businesses with more R&D expenditures performed better financially. Furthermore, whilst leverage had a negative effect on profitability, company size had a positive one. There was no discernible direct relationship between sales growth and tangibility. The results indicate that for businesses looking to improve financial results, R&D spending should be seen as a strategic long-term investment. 


Research Limitations/Implications-The study is restricted to a five-year observation period and a small sample of Sri Lankan enterprises. Without additional verification, the results could not apply to all industries or economies. Larger cross-industry samples, longitudinal designs, and an examination of the moderating impacts of corporate governance on R&D efficiency should all be included in future studies. 


Originality/Value-By offering actual data from a developing economy context specifically, Sri Lanka where few studies have been conducted on the relationship between R&D expenditure and profitability, this paper closes a sizable research gap. For businesses looking for long-term competitiveness and profitability in emerging markets, it emphasizes the strategic significance of consistent R&D investment.
