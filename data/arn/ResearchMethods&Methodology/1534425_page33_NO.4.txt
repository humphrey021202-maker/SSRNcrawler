Abstract

This study demonstrates that using share returns as the dependent variable is a preferable approach for testing value relevance of accounting information to overcome spurious regression results due to equity prices following a non-stationary, persistent process as indicated in Senthilnathan (2009). In this context, this study utilizes the Ohlson (1995) model to examine whether the level or the presence of positive goodwill amortisation helps to explain subsequent returns, where prior year goodwill amortisation and its positive presence are considered for their forward looking earnings related information. The results indicate the irrelevance of the level of prior year goodwill amortisation for explaining monthly returns. The presence of positive goodwill amortisation does, however, have a positive significant relationship with monthly returns. This implies that investors might consider the presence of positive goodwill amortisation as representing a wealth creating element in firms, since goodwill amortisation is a non-cash accounting item that results from acquisition activity, and the intended purpose of the acquisition activity would presumably be to create wealth. The results indicate that firms with positive goodwill amortisation provide higher returns.

Keywords: Ohlson (1995), equity price, returns, goodwill amortization
