Abstract

Forest plots have become the standard method to visualise the findings of meta-analyses, yet they are frequently treated as final outputs rather than starting points for interpretation. This perspective critiques the over-reliance on forest plots alone to inform conclusions, arguing that only relying on forest plots often leads to a superficial exploration and interpretation of heterogeneity, study quality, and contextual variations. When forest plots are used without additional investigations, such as sensitivity analyses, critical risk of bias assessments, subgroup analyses, and evidence appraisal, they risk producing misleading or clinically unhelpful conclusions. We advocate for a shift in how systematic reviews and meta-analyses are conducted and interpreted, emphasising clinically relevant questions, methodological transparency, and meaningful evidence appraisal beyond graphical output. Forest plots should inform interpretation, not replace it.
