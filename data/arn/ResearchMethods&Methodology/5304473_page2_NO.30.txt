Abstract

We identify the plausibly causal effects of social interaction on equity investment by exploiting random assignments in Taiwan's compulsory military service. Individuals are more likely to participate in the stock market and invest in the same stocks as their randomly assigned peers. Effects are stronger when peers are older, more educated, or have finance-related backgrounds, and when the stocks are less susceptible to behavioral biases. Peer-influenced investments increase portfolio value, enhance returns, and improve diversification. These findings demonstrate that social networks formed without homophily can aggregate valuable investment information, providing evidence that social influence enhances rather than distorts investment decisions.

Keywords: social interaction, household equity investment, random assignments, homophily
