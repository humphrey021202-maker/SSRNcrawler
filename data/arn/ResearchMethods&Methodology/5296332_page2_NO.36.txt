Abstract

This study employs a hybrid framework integrating classical financial models with advanced machine learning algorithms to detect earnings management in Chinese listed firms. Utilizing over 44,000 firm-year observations from 2008 to 2023, we evaluate 15 supervised learning models for both accrual-based and real activity earnings manipulation. Our findings demonstrate that ensemble machine learning models, particularly LightGBM and XGBoost, consistently and significantly outperform traditional approaches. Crucially, we provide novel insights through feature importance analysis, revealing key drivers of detection, and detailed error analysis, pinpointing specific firm characteristics where traditional models misclassify but machine learning models succeed. These explainable machine learning insights underscore the value of data-driven tools in improving financial transparency and oversight in emerging markets, offering practical implications for regulators, auditors, and investors.

Keywords: C53, G32, G38, M41, Earnings management, Error analysis, Financial transparency, Feature importance, Machine learning, SHAP
