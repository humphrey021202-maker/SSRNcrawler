Abstract

In this paper an attempt is made to define the Multivariate Abel Series Distributions (MASDs) of order k. From MASD of order k, a new distribution called the quasi multivariate logarithmic series distribution (QMLSD) of order k is derived. Some well known distributions are also obtained by a new method of derivation. Limiting distribution of QNMD of order k are studied.

Keywords: Multivariate Abel Series Distributions of Order K, Quasi Multivariate Logarithmic Series Distribution of Order K, Quasi Multinomial Distribution of Order K, Quasi Negative Multinomial Distribution of Order K
