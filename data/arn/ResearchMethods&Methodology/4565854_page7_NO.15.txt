Abstract

Using variables measured during an experiment fell out of favor among experimental researchers, in particular among reviewers. The reasons for this are not entirely clear, albeit reasons of causality and biasedness of statistical analyses are mentioned. Given that by categorically renouncing usage of variables measured during the experiment as moderating or mediating variables, experimental research imposes substantial limits on itself, a clear cut basis for this implicit convention is needed. This paper inquires into whether such problems exist, which coefficients – for main effects or interaction effects – are affected and what can be done to counter the problems. I find that including variables measured during the experiment, which are affected by experimental manipulations but also exert effects on their own, indeed causes a range of problems, notably changes in coefficients. However, residualizing the measured variable by first regressing it on the experimental manipulations and then using the residual in the further analysis solves the problem.

Keywords: Experiments, Moderators, Measurements, Statistical Analysis of Experiments
