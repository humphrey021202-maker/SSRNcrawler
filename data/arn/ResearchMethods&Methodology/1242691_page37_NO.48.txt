Abstract

In his seminal paper, Bruno de Finetti (1957) laid the foundations of what would become an increasingly popular branch of risk theory: the study of dividend strategies. The recent burst of research in this field encouraged the author to carry out a systematic literature review of modern collective risk theory with dividend strategies. This paper aims at a taxonomical synthesis of the 50 years of research that followed de Finetti's original paper.

Keywords: Optimal dividends, Dividend strategies, de Finetti, Risk business, Review, Skip-free upwards, Skip-free downwards, Maximization of dividends, Ruin, Reinsurance
