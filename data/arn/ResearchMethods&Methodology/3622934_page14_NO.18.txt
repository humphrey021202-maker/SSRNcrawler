Abstract

Qualitative structural modelling (QSM) techniques have assisted decision makers with the cognitive burden of structuring and interpreting complex problematic situations. Indeed, QSM pioneered the application of graph-theoretical principles and human-computer interaction. Specific approaches include ISM (Interpretive Structural Modelling); DEMATEL (DEcision MAking Trial and Evaluation Laboratory project); and MICMAC (Matrice d’Impacts Croisés-Multiplication Appliquée à un Classement). The extant QSM research seldom advances or critically assesses these techniques. Instead, ‘template’-style research prevails across a rising number of applications. We challenge this research methodology practice by investigating procedural and algebraic aspects in QSM that are now taken as self-evident, and emphasising the extent to which individual techniques overlap or differ analytically. Results highlight the following: 1) Previously unnoticed computational similarities between techniques currently regarded as mutually exclusive; 2) Incongruences between techniques that are often applied jointly, as some techniques are often stripped of their algebraic contents; 3) Potential pitfalls in those research ‘templates’ that dispense with most algebraic and algorithmic aspects of QSM. Findings provide a unified analytical perspective on QSM, overcoming research silos centred on individual techniques. Future work should address the use of digital technologies for human-computer interaction, a prominent aspect in early QSM research now surprisingly underplayed.

Keywords: Structural modelling; decision making; systems thinking; ISM, MICMAC; DEMATEL
