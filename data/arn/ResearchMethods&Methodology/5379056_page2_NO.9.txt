Abstract

This is a step-by-step roadmap for developing, writing, presenting, and refining a research paper—from that first spark of a question to the final seminar presentation. Think of it as a practical, peer-tested toolkit built to demystify the entire process. Whether you're just getting started or refining your job market paper, we hope this guide helps you move faster, stay focused, and get better feedback along the way.
