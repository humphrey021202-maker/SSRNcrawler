Abstract

This paper uses real options theories to examine how two types of uncertainty influence Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities based on these activities' unique features of enhancing revenue growth and insuring against negative events. In particular, we capture uncertainty over firms' negative social/environmental/political events (negative event uncertainty) using sentiment embedded in news reports and uncertainty in firms' product or financial market (market uncertainty) using crude oil price shocks. With the help of the machine learning method causal forest, we find that publicly-traded U.S. firms increase CSR activities when facing negative event uncertainty, but reduce CSR activities when facing market uncertainty. These relationships are moderated by firms' innovative productivity, which influences the opportunity cost of CSR investment, firms' brand equity, which influences the damage of negative events, and the competitiveness of firms' product markets, which influences CSR's value to the firm. The findings offer practical advice for corporate executives in CSR engagements and policymakers in encouraging CSR activities
