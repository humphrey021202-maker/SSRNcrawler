Abstract

This paper spells out methods of data analyses that can help to move a research project forward in cases when the initial regression results did not work out. Following this discussion of data analysis methods to get the “right” specification, the remainder of the paper considers some epistemological consequences of engaging in pre-regression data analyses. The main point stresses that current research practice is unnecessarily deficient.
