Abstract

The uniqueness of Brownian motion as a continuous martingale of independent and identical increments is viewed as coming too close to a contradiction. Continuity is then approximated more realistically by discontinuous processes with high levels of small activity. Financial relevance is addressed via performance measures taking empirical values observed in financial data. New measures of attractiveness for positive random variables are developed, studied and used to describe the more useful discontinuous continuity approximations.

Keywords: CGMY process, Sharpe Ratios, Hedging Delta Strategies.

JEL Classification: G10, G11, G12
