Abstract

A two-factor Intertemporal Capital Asset Pricing Model (ICAPM) explains returns to risk associated with fundamentals with zero alpha. In contrast, the model identifies non-zero alphas for returns involving price movements rather than fundamentals, such as price momentum and price drifts. Further, these alphas are identified as mispricing under the ICAPM: In earning alpha, investors adopt factor exposures that differ from those a multiperiod investor rationally desires. Indeed, momentum crashes are explained as departure from optimal exposures.
