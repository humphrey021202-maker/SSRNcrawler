Abstract

In this paper, I predict the probable perspective of international shipyards on managing costs to cope with climate change issues, versus managing strategic costs for developing shipbuilding and naval vessels. The hypothesis of this paper is H1: (There are probable perspectives for managing strategic costs in developing shipbuilding and naval vessels, rather than managing costs for coping with climate change issues in shipyards), which contributes to the differentiation among shipyards. I use a discriminant analysis model with a linear discriminant function to predict the probable perspective of shipyards based on independent variables that present the expected drivers most likely to influence the shipyards' probable perspectives, and also contribute to the separation of the probable perspectives of shipyards. Results from running the multiple linear discriminant model show that the most significant expected drivers contributing to the separation of shipyards' probable perspectives are: the probable perspective of shipyards towards changing mechanical engineering for ship manufacturing developments, the probable perspective of shipyards towards ships and naval vessels manufacturing developments, the probable perspective of shipyards towards cause-effect analysis for ship manufacturing developments, and the probable perspective of shipyards towards ships and naval vessels best maintenance. All perspectives have resulted from the percentage of change in the average temperature anomaly. Future research can replicate my idea in this paper, and use my insights in the area of cost management in shipyards that are expected to be working on developing shipbuilding and naval vessel, where the development of such industries in shipyards nowadays can probably be heavily affected by the issues of climate change and the rising temperature, and the noticeable risk of percentage of change in average temperature anomaly.
