Abstract

Estimating parametric models of behavior from economic experiments is becoming increasingly common. This paper discusses methods for designing an experiment so that parameters in these models are estimated as precisely as possible. Using an example of designing a battery of pairwise lottery choices, I demonstrate how experiments can be designed for various inferential goals.

Keywords: Experiment design

JEL Classification: C91
