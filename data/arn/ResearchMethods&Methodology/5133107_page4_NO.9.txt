Abstract

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative General Purpose Technology (GPT), yet significant uncertainty around firms’ AI investments remains due to their intangible and opaque nature. We examine the characteristics of firms that disclose AI activities, and whether these disclosures provide credible signals of firms’ underlying AI investments and their future economic outcomes. Using advanced textual analysis of corporate disclosures and detailed firm-level data on AI employment, we document four key findings. First, firms that disclose AI activities are generally innovative, operate in AI-intensive industries, and face greater investor scrutiny. Second, AI disclosures are positively associated with subsequent operational efficiency and AI patent filings, even after accounting for firms’ investment in AI human capital. This indicates that disclosure not only signals AI investment but also managers’ confidence in its expected returns. Third, firms that align high AI disclosures with substantial AI employment exhibit greater operational benefits than those with mismatches. Finally, these aligned firms significantly outperform peers in long-term stock returns, highlighting the crucial role of complementary human capital investment in unlocking AI’s potential. Our findings underscore that AI disclosures provide investors with a signal about firms’ underlying investments as well as managers’ confidence in those investments, thereby facilitating the market’s assessment of firms’ technological adoption and growth prospects.
