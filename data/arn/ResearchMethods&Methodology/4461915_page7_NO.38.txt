Abstract

Financial ratios are routinely used as predictors in modelling tasks where accounting information is required. The purpose of this paper is to discuss such use and to show how the effectiveness of ratiobased models can be improved. The paper first identifies the inadequacies of ratios when used as multivariate predictors, and then develops a theoretical foundation and methodology for constructing accounting-based models. Under plausible assumptions about the cross-sectional behaviour of accounting data, the paper shows that the effect of size that ratios remove can also be removed by modelling algorithms, facilitating the discovery of meaningful predictors and leading to significantly more effective models. Experiments confirm that the new methodology outperforms the conventional methodology, avoids the need to select ratios, and makes model construction less arbitrary. The new methodology can end the current uncritical use of modelling tools and unlock the full relevance of accounting information when used to support investment and other value-creating decisions.
