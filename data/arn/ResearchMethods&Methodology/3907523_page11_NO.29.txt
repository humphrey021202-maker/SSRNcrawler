Abstract

Over the past generation of market returns, factors only matter for small firms. The Fama and French (2018) 6-factor and the Hou et al. (2021) q5-factor models are commonly used to measure the performance of stock return portfolios. Importantly, I find that most of the Fama-French and q5-factor firm-level characteristics have not worked for large capitalization firms for quite a long time (i.e., 1983-2021). Small firms comprising less than 8% of the total market capitalization drive the patterns of the factor models. This paper also reexamines equity issuer performance within the context of the factor firm level characteristics.

Keywords: Fama-French 6-factor; q5-factor; q-factor; Market efficiency; Equity issuers

JEL Classification: G12; G14; G34; G40
