Using and Interpreting Fixed Effects Models

Abstract

Fixed effects are ubiquitous in financial economics studies, but many researchers have a limited understanding of how they function. This manuscript explains how fixed effects can eliminate omitted variable biases and affect standard errors, and discusses common pitfalls in using fixed effect regressions. I especially focus on how fixed effect groups (e.g., firms) that have little or no variation in X can confound coefficient estimates and interpretations, and I provide guidance on how to identify and avoid said confounds. I emphasize that FE can be a powerful tool for improving identification but can also introduce important problems of their own. Better understanding these issues will help researchers make better choices about how to design fixed effects models and carefully interpret the results thereof.

First-differencing" means to transform a dataset into within-firm period-over-period changes for all variables, and is another method for eliminating unobserved Z that are constant within firms. Looking at Table 1A, taking the first-difference within each firm means that (Zf,tZf,t-1) is equal to zero for all observations in column (v), so Zf drops out of the dataset. Firstdifference and firm FE models produce the same coefficient estimates if there are only two observations for each firm, but different coefficients in longer panels. While FE models are more common in accounting and finance studies, first-differencing does have advantages in some settings
versus first-difference models
Conclusion This paper provides an accessible primer for using and interpreting FE models, and highlights several issues that even experienced researchers may not fully appreciate. An "Author Checklist" of my main recommendations is provided in Appendix A. For a deeper dive on FE, Wooldridge (2010) is a great starting point, Grieser & Hadlock (2019) dig into the strict exogeneity assumption that I do not cover, and the cites provided throughout provide deeper dives on specific issues. I also recommend Roberts & Whited (2013) for an accessible discussion of methods for addressing endogeneity concerns
