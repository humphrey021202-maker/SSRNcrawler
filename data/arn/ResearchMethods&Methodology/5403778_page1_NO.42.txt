Abstract

In today's era of digital innovation, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming core business operations, and the fields of accounting and finance are undergoing a major shift. This study examines how Google has integrated AI technologies into its financial systems, significantly enhancing its internal financial infrastructure. Using a detailed case study method, the research focuses on Google's application of advanced AI platforms such as Vertex AI, BigQuery ML, and TensorFlow to improve financial decision-making, automate reporting processes, and strengthen compliance with global regulations. Real-world implementations explored include predictive forecasting, intelligent expense tracking, fraud detection, and alignment with international tax requirements. The findings demonstrate how AI can drive both strategic insight and operational efficiency, positioning Google as a model for modern, AI-enabled corporate finance. This research offers practical frameworks for other organizations aiming to evolve toward intelligent, data-driven financial systems.

Keywords: Artificial Intelligence in Accounting and Finance, AI-Powered Financial Forecasting, Google Vertex AI and Big Query ML, Corporate Finance Automation, Machine Learning in Financial Decision-Making
