Abstract

I propose a nonparametric iid bootstrap that achieves asymptotic refinements for t tests and confidence intervals based on the generalized method of moments (GMM) estimators even when the model is misspecified. In addition, my bootstrap does not require recentering the bootstrap moment function, which has been considered as critical for GMM. Regardless of model misspecification, the proposed bootstrap achieves the same sharp magnitude of refinements as the conventional bootstrap methods which establish asymptotic refinements by recentering in the absence of misspecification. The key idea is to link the misspecified bootstrap moment condition to the large sample theory of GMM under misspecification of Hall and Inoue (2003, Journal of Econometrics 114, 361-394). Examples of possibly misspecified moment condition models with Monte Carlo simulation results are provided: (i) Combining data sets, and (ii) invalid instrumental variables.

Keywords: nonparametric iid bootstrap, asymptotic refinement, Edgeworth expansion, GMM, model misspecification
