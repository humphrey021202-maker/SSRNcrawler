Abstract

In this paper we set forth a robust and generalized research design for investigating potential EM and other firm behaviors hypothesized to deviate from some expected value. The design is robust in that it relies only on conservative rank-based variables and utilizes binomial test statistics, in addition to a bootstrap. Multiple regressions are proposed that rely only on indicator variables which are more conservative and robust than continuous-variables’ correlations. It is generalized in that it can capture hypothesized EM of many types, including positive, negative, large and small deviations. This design has wide potential application in that it can be applied in many accounting and finance research settings where firms’ deviations from expectations can be estimated in that it suggests how such deviations can be robustly associated with other factors of interest, such as firms’ performance, or management compensation, as well as managing reported financial income.

Keywords: statistics, earnings management
