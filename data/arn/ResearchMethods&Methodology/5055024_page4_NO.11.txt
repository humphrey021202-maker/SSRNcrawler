Abstract

The wide applications of machine learning techniques to big data allow researchers to dig deep into novel large-scale data sets, such as job postings, earnings calls, and news reports. They also equip researchers with powerful tools to study important but subtle/challenging topics that are impossible to explore before on a large scale, such as corporate culture and climate risk exposure. In this review, I survey various applications of diFerent machine learning techniques in ESG research, beginning with foundational methods such as bag-of-words, progressing through topic modeling, word embedding, and BERT, and culminating with generative artificial intelligence (AI) and other advanced machine learning approaches. I conclude by outlining future directions for using big data and machine learning in ESG research.

Keywords: Big data, machine learning, ESG, bag-of-words, topic modelling, word embedding, BERT, generative AI, climate change, climate risk, corporate culture JEL classifications: C45, C55, G32, G38, Z1
