Null Hypothesis Choices are a Problem, An Excess of False Positives is Not

Abstract

Ohlson (2022) argues that erroneous falsifications of true null hypotheses are widespread in the accounting field. As a falsification is false only if the null is truly true, it follows that Ohlson’s case rests on his presumption that the field’s null hypotheses are commonly true. While true nulls may be common in pure scientific discovery oriented fields, there is little basis for thinking that they abound in the accounting field. Consequently, Ohlson provides a misdirected narrative that points the discipline away from engaging what truly plagues it—the widespread testing of irrelevant hypotheses.

Keywords: Null Hypotheses, Priors, Accounting Research Quality

JEL Classification: C12, B40, M40
