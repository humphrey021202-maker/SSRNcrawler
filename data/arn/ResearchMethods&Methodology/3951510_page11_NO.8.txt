Abstract

Casey, Gao, Kirschenheiter, Li, and Pandit (2016) present a definitive model of financial statement articulation using the Financial Statement Balancing Model (FSBM) from Compustat. We simplify their approach by classifying variables as either (1) line item accounts (e.g., inventory); or (2) calculable amounts (e.g., total assets). We illustrate how this classification allows Compustat users to efficiently resolve nulls to increase sample size and data quality in empirical analyses. We expand on Casey et al. 2016 by presenting top-level, sub-level and sub-sub-level models that maintain data integrity and articulation, providing users flexibility based on their needs. Finally, to highlight the versatility of Compustat's data, we present numerous ways to present the cash flow statement, roll-forwards to estimate cash flow statements when unavailable (prior to 1988), and owners' equity statement roll-forwards.

Keywords: financial statement articulation, Compustat, double-entry bookkeeping

JEL Classification: C81, M41, M48
