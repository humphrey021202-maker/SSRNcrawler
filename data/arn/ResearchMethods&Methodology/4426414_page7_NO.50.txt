Abstract

Textual data has drawn much research interest in the recent accounting literature. However, there has also been some criticisms about the seeming lack of transparency and hence replicability of how texts are processed and measured. In this paper I aim to have a better understanding of such criticisms by conducting a comprehensive review of the textual processing and reporting practice in accounting research. In so doing, I also discuss my approaches and experience related to my own textual research projects. For the sake of transparency and data sharing, I intend to offer my data to interested researchers for academic use.

Keywords: Textual Processing, Extraction, Risk Factors, MD&A, 10-K, Quality Control
