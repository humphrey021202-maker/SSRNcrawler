Abstract

The bounded rationality assumption does not contradict the rationality assumption. Specifically, in small decisions it is rational to act like boundedly rational agents. This proposition may provide answers to many challenges to rational choice economic theory that are posed by behavioral economics. In particular, it provides an answer to the "Rabin paradox", and challenges our understanding of how to refute the rationality assumption.

Keywords: rationality, bounded rationality, mistake, computation cost
