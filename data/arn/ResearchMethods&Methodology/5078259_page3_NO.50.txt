Abstract

The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Big Data analytics is transforming various industries, and forensic accounting is no exception. This paper explores the role of AI and Big Data in modern forensic accounting practices, focusing on how these technologies are enhancing fraud detection, improving investigative efficiency, and addressing complex financial crimes. AI algorithms, such as machine learning and predictive analytics, are proving effective in detecting anomalies, automating data processing, and identifying potential fraud risks in real-time. Meanwhile, Big Data tools enable forensic accountants to analyze vast amounts of structured and unstructured data, uncovering hidden patterns and trends that were previously undetectable.

Despite these advancements, the adoption of AI and Big Data in forensic accounting is not without challenges. The paper examines the barriers to implementation, including high costs, data privacy concerns, and a lack of technical expertise. Ethical considerations related to automated decision-making and accountability in AI-driven investigations are also discussed. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, industry reports, and real-world case studies, this research identifies the benefits and limitations of AI and Big Data in forensic accounting, offering recommendations for overcoming the obstacles to their widespread adoption.

By providing an in-depth analysis of current trends and future implications, this paper aims to contribute valuable insights into the evolving role of technology in forensic accounting, proposing strategies for integrating AI and Big Data tools effectively while addressing the ethical and practical challenges that arise in their use.
