Abstract

Questions have been asked for years on how the volatility surface changes as underlying spot prices move. To the extent that volatility, levels of skew, or levels of term structure of fixed strike options have expected movements versus changes in spot, then a Black-Scholes delta may not be optimal. This paper explores whether any relationship exists between changes in skew and changes in spot price. We find that this relationship for the S&P 500 is mildly negative while the relationship for single stocks is significantly positive but becoming less positive since 2010.

Keywords: volatility skew, implied volatility, volatility surface, single stock options
