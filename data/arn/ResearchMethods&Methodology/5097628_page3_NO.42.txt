Abstract

This study examines 1,754 publicly disclosed U.S. federal AI use cases from AI.gov, offering an unparalleled opportunity to analyze their distribution, benefits, costs, and return on investment (ROI). Leveraging advanced AI models from OpenAI (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini) and Anthropic (Claude 3.2), we developed the McIntyre and Liew Model (MLM) as a structured pipeline to quantify and rank AI initiatives across 37 federal departments and agencies. The analysis reveals several key insights. First, AI use cases are uniquely concentrated in healthcare, public safety, and infrastructure agencies such as HHS, VA, DHS, DOI, and USAID, reflecting these sectors' leadership in addressing critical public needs. Second, "Mission-Enabling" is the most dominant topic area, emphasizing the focus on advancing agency-specific missions. Finally, high ROI applications often leverage commercially available tools, showcasing the potential for integrating big tech AI innovations with agency-specific goals.
This dataset’s uniqueness lies in its focus on public interest-driven AI initiatives, which diverge from profit-maximization objectives typically found in private sector analyses, while simultaneously offering a pioneering analytical foundation for evaluating diverse public sector challenges. The MLM framework capitalizes on this distinctive dataset, transforming textual disclosures into actionable quantitative metrics, akin to financial measures like price-to-earnings ratios. This scalable methodology not only facilitates aggregation across agencies, AI techniques, and operational problems but also provides a rich foundation for exploring innovative applications of AI to yet unaddressed government and civil challenges in general. By highlighting the potential of adopting cutting-edge AI tools, this study underscores the alignment of these technologies with mission-critical objectives and public interest goals.
This research highlights the dataset as a groundbreaking resource, establishing a benchmark for future AI evaluations across both public and private sectors. The inventory itself provides an immediate platform for fostering discussions and collaboration within government. The MLM framework amplifies this potential by offering a foundation for quantitative ROI assessments, while also laying the groundwork for qualitative evaluation approaches that transcend financial metrics—one of which we plan to explore in follow-up work. Ultimately, we envision this framework enabling the creation of synthetic solutions to address complex and unexplored challenges within the public sector.
