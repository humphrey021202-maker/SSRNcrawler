Abstract

As artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly permeates the fintech sector, the ethical implications surrounding algorithmic decision-making-specifically fairness, transparency, and accountability-have become critical concerns for both industry stakeholders and regulators. This study introduces the "Relay of Responsibility" framework, a triadic sequential model that examines how user perceptions of fairness and transparency influence fintech firms' ethical readiness and explainability practices, which subsequently shape policymakers' governance priorities. Utilizing Fairness Heuristic Theory, Stakeholder Theory, and Institutional Theory, the study employs a Triadic Sequential Structural Equation Modeling (TS-SEM) approach with multiinformant data from 385 fintech users, 60 professionals, and 30 policymakers. The findings demonstrate that users' fairness perceptions and transparency expectations significantly influence fintech firms' ethical practices, which in turn mediate the relationship between user expectations and policymaker priorities. The results position fintech firms as ethical intermediaries, translating societal expectations into institutional governance signals. This research contributes to both theoretical advancements in AI ethics governance and offers practical insights for building trust, ensuring accountability, and designing inclusive policy frameworks within fintech ecosystems.

Keywords: Ethical AI Governance, Fintech Ecosystems, Triadic Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), Algorithmic Fairness, Transparency, Multi-Stakeholder Governance
