Abstract

We study how new information about a firm’s future volatility affects market expectation of its suppliers’ volatility, using a measure based on the change of option-implied forward volatility around corporate disclosure events. We show analytically and empirically that the change of forward volatility is an unbiased measure of new volatility-related information. Our analysis identifies a positive volatility information transfer (VIT) effect from customers’ public disclosures to suppliers. Customers’ unbundled management guidance generates a stronger VIT effect than their earnings announcement. The VIT effect is stronger if customers are larger, have more suppliers, or have a stronger economic link with suppliers.

Keywords: Customer-to-supplier information transfer; Management guidance; Model-free implied volatility; Earnings announcement; Supply-chain relationship

JEL Classification: G12, G13, G14, G17
