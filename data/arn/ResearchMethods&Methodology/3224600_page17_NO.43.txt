Abstract

We hypothesize that investors with limited cognitive capacity are unable to fully process complex transactions such as mergers and acquisitions over a short announcement window. Consequently, short-term announcement returns are poor indications of long-term value creation. Analyzing a sample of deals categorized by industry merger waves, we identify acquirer overvaluation as a critical, hard-to-process "intangible" factor affecting long-term performance. Our evidence shows that short-term acquirer returns largely reflect easy-to-process "tangible" information such as deal characteristics, while deeper valuation effects take years to influence stock prices. Our results highlight the limited utility of short-term announcement returns in assessing acquisition value. 

Keywords: acquirer announcement return, long-run stock performance, tangible and intangible information, equity valuation, merger waves, limited attention JEL Codes: G14, G34, G41
