Abstract

A number of studies have begun to question the appropriateness of the wide-spread and pervasive usage of using regressions in two-step research designs in the accounting literature to obtain variables. The use of residuals from a first-step model as a dependent variable in a second-step has been used in contexts such as earnings management and unexpected audit fees. In this paper, I provide a discussion of the issues within the use of residuals from a first-step model in a second-step.. Taking the case of discretionary accruals models, I demonstrate some of the model specification issues explicitly and implicitly considered within these criticisms. I then add a discussion over some concerns regarding the economic interpretation in the use of first-step residuals.

Keywords: Earnings management, research design, residuals, two-step models, unexpected audit fees

JEL Classification: M00, M40, M41, M42
