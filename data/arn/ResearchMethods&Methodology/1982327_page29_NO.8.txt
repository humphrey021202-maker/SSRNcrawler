Abstract

We present a generic framework to manage gap risk for financial products involving large digital risks due to discontinuous payouts or barriers. The approach modifies the boundary conditions of the pricing PDE so that a given delta limit is not breached. In comparison to other techniques such as simply shifting the barriers it produces much smaller price offsets to the original fair.

Keywords: gap risk, barrier management, overhedging

JEL Classification: C63
