Abstract

Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is a statistical method used to determine whether a sample originated from a larger population distribution. We provide an alternate method of determination using the continuous cumulative distribution functions derived from degree one lower partial moment ratios. The resulting analysis is performed with no restrictive assumptions on the underlying distribution or the associated error terms.

Keywords: ANOVA, lower partial moment, continuous CDF
