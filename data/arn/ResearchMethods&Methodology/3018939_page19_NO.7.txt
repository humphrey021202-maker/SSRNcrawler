Abstract

In this paper I provide details of an extensive resource center to support Faff’s (2015, 2021a) pitching template framework – a framework primarily designed to provide a succinct and methodical approach to pitching a new research proposal to an academic expert. Specifically, I give a comprehensive update and latest information (including a multitude of directly actionable hyperlinks), most notably, organized around six core resource pillars: (a) a suite of SSRN working papers; (b) alternative template designs and applications; (c) an e-library of worked examples of the pitching template; (d) an associated webportal, “PitchMyResearch.com”; (e) an assortment of PPT slide decks; and (f) an array of YouTube videos. The paper then showcases a wide range of useful research training tool applications exploiting the Pitching Research framework.

Keywords: pitching resource center; new research ideas; pitching; template; research proposal; novice researcher advice; supervisor advice; research mentor advice; PhD coordinator advice; innovations that inspire
