Abstract

We examine how the transition from local GAAPs to IAS/IFRS of companies that are publicly traded on a European stock exchange affects earnings management. To measure earnings management we apply 15 different proxies. In analyzing 17 European countries and more than 18,000 firm-year observations we observe that companies applying IAS/IFRS experience less earnings management than firms applying domestic standards. However, while this is true for Central European countries, UK and Ireland (English legal origin) as well as Northern European Countries (Scandinavian legal origin) show a different behavior. They already have lower earnings management levels prior to IAS/IFRS adoption compared to the rest of Europe. For these countries the transition from local GAAPs to IAS/IFRS does not change their earnings management behavior. Apart from this, we show that firm size and time have no significant effect on earnings management and that growth firms exhibit higher levels of earnings management. In comparing the results for all 15 earnings management measures we conclude that different measures seem to capture different dimensions of earnings management.

JEL Classification: M41, M43, M44, M47
