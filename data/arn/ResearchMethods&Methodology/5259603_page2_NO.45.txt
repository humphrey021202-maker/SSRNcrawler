Abstract

The dynamic nature of scholarly research demands a thorough comprehension of the important information sources, essential gaps, and useful measures for assessing scholarly influence. In order to discover important research gaps that impede advancement in academic pursuits, this study investigates the uncharted territories within various fields. It looks into the various information sources that influence current research, from established scholarly journals to newly developed open-access platforms. The study also explores the several evaluative metrics used to gauge scholarly influence, examining their usefulness, drawbacks, and changing characteristics in an academic setting that is becoming more digital and linked. By combining these components, the study hopes to offer a comprehensive framework for negotiating the challenges of scholarly research and impact assessment, providing guidance to scholars, decision-makers, and organizations looking to promote scholarly activities.

Keywords: Research gap, H index, impact factor, cite score, information source, altmetrics
