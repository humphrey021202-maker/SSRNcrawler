Abstract

Relative to quantitative methods traditionally used in accounting and finance, textual analysis is substantially less precise. Thus, understanding the art is of equal importance to understanding the science. In this survey we describe the nuances of the method and, as users of textual analysis, some of the tripwires in implementation. We also review the contemporary textual analysis literature and highlight areas of future research.

Keywords: Textual analysis; sentiment analysis; bag-of-words; readability; word lists; Zipf’s law; cosine similarity; Naïve Bayes
