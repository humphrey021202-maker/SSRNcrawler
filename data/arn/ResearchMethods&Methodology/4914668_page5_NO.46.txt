Abstract

 We develop a systematic approach to bounding entropy by incorporating conditioning information. Our bound features a fixed-point solution to a dynamic asset-allocation problem, interpretable as generalized "Sharpe ratios" in the entropy space, and balances exploiting physical return predictability and hedging risk-neutral higher-order moments. Applying our approach to various return predictors, we document enhanced entropy restrictions that more than double the benchmark equity risk premium. Our bound is sharper than the corresponding optimally scaled Hansen-Jagannathan bound that incorporates higher-order moments over the short horizons. We highlight our results' implications for diagnosing leading macro-finance models and their consistency across different data.

Keywords: Conditioning information, Equity risk premium, Risk-neutral moments, Entropy, Stochastic discount factor

JEL Classification: E44, G1, G12
