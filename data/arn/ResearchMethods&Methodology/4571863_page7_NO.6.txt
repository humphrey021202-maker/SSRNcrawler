Abstract

Our study examines the predictive power of Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) sections in the context of bankruptcy prediction. Leveraging contextual sentence embeddings from a pre-trained Transformer model (BERT), we introduce a novel prediction model designed to identify MD&A sentences associated with bankruptcies. Our study demonstrates the superiority of this sentence-level model over various document-level approaches, particularly when excluding boilerplate content. Furthermore, our sentence-level approach enhances model interpretability by uncovering high-risk topics such as financial losses and the reduction in production, cost, and workforce. Lastly, we provide insights into critical high-risk disclosure patterns through structural and syntactical analysis.

Keywords: Bankruptcy prediction, Text mining, BERT, Sentence embeddings, Machine learning
