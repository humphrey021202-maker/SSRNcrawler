Abstract

This paper explores the potential of using linear regression in artificial intelligence and business intelligence for strategic planning in maintaining competitive market edge and share.

Linear regression has become a powerful tool for predicting and modelling complex relationships between variables in various fields, including business intelligence. With the advent of big data, businesses are now able to collect vast amounts of data and use it to gain insights into customer behavior, market trends, and other factors that impact their performance. By using linear regression, businesses can model the relationships between these variables and make informed decisions that lead to improved performance and competitive advantage.

The paper provides a theoretical background and practical examples of using linear regression in business intelligence and strategic planning. The findings suggest that linear regression is an essential tool for businesses seeking to maintain their competitive edge and share in their respective market. The paper concludes by highlighting the importance of integrating linear regression into the business intelligence and strategic planning process to improve decision-making and enhance business performance.

Keywords: Business Intelligence, Artificial Intelligence, Classification, Regression Models, ML Algorithms, Finance
