Abstract

Gaver and Utke (2019) show that auditor industry specialist measures can be improved by accounting for the length of time an auditor has been a specialist (specialist tenure) in addition to auditor market share. In this note, I provide the code for calculating Gaver and Utke’s (2019) specialist tenure variables to enable subsequent researchers to use these variables. While this code focuses on industry specialist tenure, accounting for tenure may also be important as archival audit researchers begin measuring audit expertise in areas other than industry expertise, such as auditing goodwill, multinational firms, or tax accounts.

Keywords: Auditor Changes, Auditor Tenure, Industry Specialization

JEL Classification: M40
