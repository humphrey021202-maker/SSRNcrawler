Abstract

Since 2005, IASB standards have become mandatory for publicly listed European companies in the consolidated financial statements (Regulation 1606/2002 of European Parliament and the Council). The adoption of IAS 19: Employee benefits (2004) provided managers with an important accounting choice affecting the time and placement of actuarial gains and losses recognition. IAS 19 enables a choice between three major accounting methods related to the recognition of actuarial gains and losses: profit or loss approach, equity approach and corridor approach. The objective of this paper is to investigate the determinants of the choice of the accounting method of actuarial gains and losses. We manually collect information about the accounting method of recognising actuarial gains and losses adopted by 523 European companies listed in STOXX 600, in the first year that they adopt IASB standards. We applied regression analysis to identify the companies' specific characteristics that affect the choice of the accounting method for actuarial gains and losses. The results of this study indicate that country, industry and leverage are important determinants of the actuarial gains and losses accounting method choice.

Keywords: actuarial gains and losses, corridor, equity, benefit plans

Consistent with previous studies, our study confirms that financial information can not be entirely comparable although companies apply the same accounting standards. IAS 19 allows us to investigate why companies choose to recognise actuarial gains and losses in profit or loss, totally or partially
