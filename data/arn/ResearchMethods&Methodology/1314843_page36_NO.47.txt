Abstract

This paper accomplishes a descriptive analysis of scientific production in the context of Spanish accounting research, based on researchers' characteristics such as their current employing university, where they obtained their doctorate or in what academic leve1 they actually are employed.

This study also carnes out an exploratory investigation of the determinants of scientific production, focusing on incentives. With this aim, a number of taslcs have been accomplished: first, it was necessary to build a database that contains the Spanish researchers. Second, in order to select those journals that are useful for accounting research diffusion, their qualities were examined. Finally, scientific production was quantified using the conventional variables. The paper concludes that the institutional factor seems to be lidced with scientific production, while the professional incentives do not seem to be determinant in the whole.
