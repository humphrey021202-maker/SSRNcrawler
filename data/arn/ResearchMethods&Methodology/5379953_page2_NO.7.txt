Abstract

The contemporary scientific establishment has cultivated an empirical orthodoxy that prioritizes experimental data over theoretical understanding, fundamentally reversing the proper hierarchy of scientific inquiry established during the Newtonian era. This paper argues that correct scientific theories serve as the sole standard for validating experimental results, challenging the prevailing doctrine that positions experimentation as the ultimate arbiter of scientific truth. Through examination of historical precedents, current publishing practices, educational paradigms, and the resulting stagnation in fundamental scientific progress, we demonstrate that the over-emphasis on experimental validation has led to a reversion toward pre-scientific methodologies reminiscent of alchemy. We contend that theoretical reasoning, grounded in mathematical logic, represents the true foundation of scientific knowledge, while experiments serve primarily as tools for identifying logical inconsistencies in theoretical frameworks rather than as independent sources of truth.

Keywords: theoretical physics, scientific methodology, experimental validation, scientific stagnation, epistemology, mathematical logic, scientific education
