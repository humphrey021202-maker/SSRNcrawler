Abstract

Brazil is undertaking its most ambitious tax overhaul in decades, pivoting from a fragmented, cascading regime toward models endorsed by the OECD and adopted across the G-20. Constitutional Amendment 132/2023 introduces a destination-based dual VAT-federal CBS and sub-national IBS-to replace five existing levies, while Provisional Measure 1 262/2024 launches OECD Pillar Two rules that guarantee a 15 % effective rate for large multinationals. Parallel corporate-governance bills (PL 2 925/2023) strengthen minority-shareholder rights and expand disclosure duties. This article analyses the reform's architecture, compares it to international benchmarks, and evaluates its potential to enhance transparency and capital-market confidence. We conclude that, despite implementation risks, the package aligns Brazil with global best practice and could narrow the "Brazil cost" in cross-border investment.

Keywords: Brazil, Tax Reform, VAT (IBS/CBS), OECD Pillar Two, Country-by-Country Reporting, Shareholder Protection, Transparency, Corporate Governance, Emerging Markets
