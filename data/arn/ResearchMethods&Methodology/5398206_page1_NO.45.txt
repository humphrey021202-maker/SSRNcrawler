Abstract

This paper aims to structure methodological steps for conducting a systematic literature review (SLR) using comprehensive, advanced and quantitative approaches. This study contributes to the state of SLR methodological references by offering more comprehensive insights from a broader range of bibliometric analyses and a scientific approach for structuring future research agendas. In addition, this study presents a comprehensive simulated literature review and leveraging advanced text-mining technology for bibliometric data processing. Our demonstration exposes the full cycle of methodological protocols comprising data collection, cleaning, descriptive analysis, and bibliometric analysis. This paper utilises cutting-edge tools to present 23 insightful visualisations and three tabulated metrics. We employ a range of bibliometric analyses to identify current research streams and formulate future research directions. Therefore, this study provides scholars with comprehensive, advanced, scientific, and replicable methodological guidance to conduct, present, and publish a high-quality SLR.

Keywords: Systematic Literature Review, Advanced Methodology, Text Mining, Bibliometric Analysis, Simulation
