Abstract

I translate familiar concepts of discrete-time time-series to continuous-time equivalent. I cover lag operators, ARMA models, the relation between levels and differences, integration and cointegration, and the Hansen-Sargent prediction formulas.

Keywords: continuous time linear models, ARMA, cointegration prediction

JEL Classification: C1
