Abstract

A significant negative correlation between conservative inventory valuation methods and a high degree of uncertainty avoidance could be found. These findings could be also found for a questionnaire on risk perception. This correlation could not be shown for risk-related financial ratios. The expansion of the risk perception questionnaire study to more countries and participants, increased research in the field of profitability ratios and more concrete variables is recommended.
