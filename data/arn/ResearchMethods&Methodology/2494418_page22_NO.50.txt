Abstract

In this paper, we correct the adverse impact of estimation risk on both portfolio weights and performance with two new equity allocation methods we implement with estimation-free and estimated ex-ante returns. Portfolios with estimation-free ex-ante returns and systematic-to-unsystematic risk weights have statistically higher Sharpe ratios than both similar portfolios with estimated ex-ante returns and 1/N’th portfolios. Optimal portfolio methods with well-behaved weights guide investors in a way not hitherto possible (normative portfolio theory).

Keywords: Equity Allocation, Estimation Risk, Ex Ante Returns, Sharpe Ratio

JEL Classification: G14, G15
