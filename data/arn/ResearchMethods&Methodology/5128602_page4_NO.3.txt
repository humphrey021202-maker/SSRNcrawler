Abstract

This chapter explores the fundamentals of quantitative research design, emphasizing its systematic and empirical approach to investigating phenomena through numerical data. It highlights the key objectives of quantitative research, including measuring variables, testing hypotheses, establishing relationships, ensuring generalizability, and enhancing objectivity. Various research designs-descriptive, correlational, experimental, and quasi-experimental are discussed, demonstrating their applicability across different disciplines such as social sciences, healthcare, business, and technology. The chapter also contrasts qualitative and quantitative research methodologies and elaborates on critical components like research questions, hypotheses, variables, sampling methods, data collection techniques, and statistical analysis. Through structured methodologies and statistical tools, quantitative research ensures reliability, replicability, and scientific progress.

Keywords: Statistics, Research Method, Quantitative Analysis, Marketing Research, Research Design, Business Administration, marketing
