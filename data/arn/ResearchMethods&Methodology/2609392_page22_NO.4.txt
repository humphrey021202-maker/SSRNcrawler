Abstract

This paper investigates the potential of using a frequency response mode to reduce the dilution effect of non-diagnostic evidence on auditors’ fraud risk judgments. In two experiments, we test one hypothesis and examine a research question related to the dilution effect where response mode (frequency versus probability) and type of non-diagnostic or irrelevant information are manipulated between participants. Results of the hypothesis tests show that auditors’ fraud risk judgments demonstrate a significantly lower dilution effect when they evaluate diagnostic and non-diagnostic or irrelevant evidence using a frequency response mode, as compared to the probability response mode; this effect is most pronounced when auditors are provided with favorable non-diagnostic or irrelevant evidence.

Keywords: Dilution; Fraud risk; Frequency response mode; Non-diagnostic information

JEL Classification: M4, M40, M420
