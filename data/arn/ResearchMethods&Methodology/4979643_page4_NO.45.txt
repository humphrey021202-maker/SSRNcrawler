Abstract

In the era of accelerated digitalization, blockchain technology is becoming a promising solution for optimizing financial and accounting information flows, bringing transparency, security and efficiency in transaction management. The implementation of blockchain in a Billing Data and Payments/Receipts (CDFPI) confirmation system, highlights how smart contracts and security protocols can reduce the risk of errors and fraud, while ensuring voluntary tax compliance. By integrating the public blockchain, the proposed system offers a robust architecture that guarantees both the confidentiality and verifiability of transactions, contributing to the modernization and security of accounting processes.

Keywords: blockchain technology, smart contract, financial-accounting information flow, eInvoice JEL Classification: F52
