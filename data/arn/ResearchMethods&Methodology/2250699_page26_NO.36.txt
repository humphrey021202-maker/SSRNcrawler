Abstract

In the present article, we develop some asymptotically power on partially sequential nonparametric tests for monitoring structural changes. Our test procedures are based on Wilcoxon score. We use the idea of curved stopping boundaries. We derive some exact results and perform simulation studies to provide various properties of the tests. We see that one of the proposed procedures significantly controls the Type-I error rate. This procedure may be very effective for fluctuation monitoring. We illustrate the procedures by using real life data from the stock market.

Keywords: Controlling Type-I error rate, Curved stopping boundaries, Monitoring structural changes, Partially sequential sampling, Wilcoxon score
