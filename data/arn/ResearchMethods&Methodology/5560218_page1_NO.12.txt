Abstract

This study investigates the interconnection between geopolitical dynamics, Environmental Management Accounting (EMA), and ESG reporting practices, with a particular focus on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Geopolitical uncertainty, including wars, sanctions, policy instability, and energy disruptions, has emerged as a critical factor influencing corporate resilience and sustainability strategies. To address this, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was conducted on 51 peer-reviewed articles published between 2021 and 2025. The review employed PRISMA protocols and bibliometric analysis to identify patterns, methodological approaches, and empirical findings relevant to the nexus of geopolitics, EMA, and ESG. The findings reveal that geopolitical risks significantly amplify firm-level volatility, increase compliance costs, and disrupt supply chains, leaving SMEs particularly vulnerable. At the same time, EMA adoption emerges as a strategic cost-management tool that lowers compliance burdens and strengthens resource efficiency, while ESG reporting enhances investor confidence and reduces financing costs. Evidence from replicated empirical studies demonstrates that integrating EMA and ESG practices provides a dual mechanism that buffers the adverse effects of geopolitical shocks and transforms them into drivers of sustainable competitiveness. This study contributes theoretically by reframing geopolitical dynamics not only as uncontrollable external risks but also as catalysts for sustainability innovation. Practically, it offers a roadmap for SMEs to adopt EMA and ESG reporting as complementary strategies for survival and resilience in volatile environments. Policymakers and investors are likewise encouraged to support and reward these practices, ensuring broader financial stability and sustainability at both firm and systemic levels.
