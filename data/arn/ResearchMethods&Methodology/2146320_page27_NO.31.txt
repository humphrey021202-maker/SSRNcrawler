Abstract

We study how investor sentiment aects the speed with which prices reflect information. Price discovery is more timely for firms with greater sensitivity to sentiment, as measured by a sentiment beta. Our research improves our understanding of the price formation process when sentiment is not assumed to be constant. Our research design is novel as it considers a sentiment beta as well as economy-wide sentiment. This provides more comprehensive evidence on the impact of differing types of sentiment on the price formation process.

Keywords: Price Discovery, Sentiment, Timeliness

JEL Classification: G1, G14, G02
