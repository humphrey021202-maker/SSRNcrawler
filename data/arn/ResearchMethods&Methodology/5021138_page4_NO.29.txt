Abstract

As interest in cryptocurrencies continues to surge, driven by each new price rally, crypto assets have solidified their position as one of the main asset classes in global markets. Unlike traditional assets, which primarily trade during standard working hours, cryptocurrencies trade 24/7, presenting a unique landscape of liquidity and volatility. This continuous trading environment has prompted us to investigate how Bitcoin, the flagship cryptocurrency, behaves across intraday and overnight periods. With Bitcoin’s growing availability to both retail and institutional investors through ETFs and other investment vehicles, we hypothesized that trading activity in these distinct timeframes could reveal patterns similar to those seen in traditional markets, where returns are often impacted by liquidity shifts during off-peak hours.

Keywords: cryptocurrencies, market timing, momentum, own-research, seasonality, trendfollowing
