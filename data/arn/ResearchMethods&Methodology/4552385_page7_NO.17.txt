Abstract

In this paper, I model the impact of climate risk disclosure on climate risk sharing among investors. I show that this disclosure can promote efficient risk sharing by helping climate-concerned investors identify stocks that effectively hedge climate risk, and I analyze its impact on investors' equilibrium portfolio choices. I then study when firms' incentives to voluntarily disclose their climate risks are aligned with social efficiency and thus when disclosure mandates can enhance risk sharing. Finally, I demonstrate that, by improving risk sharing, climate risk disclosure reduces the climate risk premium among stocks held by climate-concerned investors. As a result, it can lower the valuations of firms with low climate exposures and the market as a whole.

Keywords: climate risk disclosure, carbon disclosure, investor welfare, disclosure regulation, risk sharing, climate finance
