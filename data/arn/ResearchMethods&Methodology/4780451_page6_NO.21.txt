Empirical Research: Prescribing Credible Methods

Abstract

The paper initially elaborates on some basic hurdles that researchers must confront to satisfy publication requirements. Because acceptable data analysis often seems arbitrary and lacking in appeal, it raises questions about what works effectively when one tries to focus on disinterested findings—as opposed to meeting publication objectives. Following discussions about researchers’ experience with commonly used research procedures, the paper presents 4 basic alternative data analysis methods (or tools). Though these generally do not show up in the (accounting) literature, they are easy to implement and understand. Most important, the methods highlight data characteristics of intrinsic interest.

Keywords: Empirical research, methodologies, data analyis, accounting research methods
