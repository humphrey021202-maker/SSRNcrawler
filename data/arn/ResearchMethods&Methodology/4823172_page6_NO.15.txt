Abstract

We find that focal firms (i.e., firms without public bonds) reduce management forecasts when investors can observe peer firms’ bond price signals via TRACE. This effect is stronger when focal and peer firms share greater commonalities and peers’ bond prices are more informative, but weaker when peers’ stock market information environment is richer and when focal firms have greater litigation risks or equity issuance motives. Investor reactions to focal firms’ management forecasts also decline post-TRACE. These results suggest that information reflected in peers’ bond prices mitigates investor uncertainty about focal firms’ economic conditions, thus diminishing the usefulness of management forecasts. Instead, focal firms increase qualitative disclosures through 8-Ks and press releases, consistent with disclosure substitution theory. Finally, focal firms’ stock liquidity improves, indicating that managers’ strategic disclosure adjustments post-TRACE result in net informational benefits. Our study is the first to document the peer effects of the secondary bond market.
