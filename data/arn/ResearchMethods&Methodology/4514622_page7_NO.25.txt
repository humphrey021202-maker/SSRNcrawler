Abstract

Estimates of the “normal” tax rate faced by the firm are required for forecasting, valuation, earnings quality analysis, and other contexts. They can be derived using the reported effective tax rate (ETR), based on the statutory tax rate, by analyzing ETR reconciliation data, or by utilizing other disclosures. This study develops an algorithm that combines the first two methods and incorporates additional information to estimate the normal tax rate. It then shows that this measure performs well in predicting ETRs over the near-to-intermediate term and in identifying transitory components of reported income taxes.

Keywords: Income taxes, effective tax rate, statutory tax rate, earnings quality, forecasting, financial statement analysis, valuation

JEL Classification: G12, G17, G31, G32, M41
