Abstract

We develop a new measure of IPO firms’ engagement in disruptive innovation, DI score (DIS), using textual analysis of prospectuses and machine learning. DIS positively predicts IPO outcomes (i.e., initial return, trading volume, bid-ask spread, and price revision), consistent with DI entailing high uncertainty and information asymmetry. The initial returns of high DIS IPOs do not reverse over the next year, contradicting the hype hypothesis. Finally, DIS predicts post-IPO firm policies and higher firm valuation. Our findings imply that DI is a risky but valuable activity for firms, and DIS captures DI activities of IPO firms beyond R&D and patenting.
