Abstract

Conventional wisdom suggests that benchmarking returns can help investors better assess their performance and improve decision-making. I challenge this assumption using an experiment where investors participate in a stock market trading simulation and estimate their future portfolio balance. I independently vary the overall market return and manipulate benchmark salience to test how market benchmarks impact investors' judgments and decisions. I find that highlighting personal portfolio returns relative to a market benchmark increases overconfidence and decreases future investment in diversified funds for outperformers. However, I also find that highlighting relative performance decreases overconfidence among underperformers but has little effect on their investing decisions. Finally, I also document that providing market benchmarks increases investor overconfidence when past market returns are positive and decreases overconfidence when past market returns are negative. These findings suggest that using market benchmarks to curb investor overconfidence may ironically backfire in many settings.
