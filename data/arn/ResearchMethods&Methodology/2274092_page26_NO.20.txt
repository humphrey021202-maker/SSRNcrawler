Abstract

Cram et al. (2009) argued that conditional logit regression could produce better regression results than ordinary logit regression when applied to matched samples. But their evidence of conditional logit regression’s advantages over ordinary logit regression is not statistically robust, for they used only one time simulation result to support their conclusion. In this comment, we modify the simulation design used by Cram et al. (2009) to generate massive times simulation results to form the distribution of parameter estimation. Thus the statistically robust evidence could be found from the estimation distribution to support Cram et al. (2009)’s conclusion about conditional logit regression.

Keywords: accounting, matched samples, conditional logit
