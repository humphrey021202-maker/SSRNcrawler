Abstract

The National Budget Bill 2025–2029 of the Oriental Republic of Uruguay marks a turning point in the country’s tax system. The provisions included are not limited to technical adjustments in legislative drafting; rather, they configure a substantial redesign with direct implications for local taxpayers and, in particular, for multinational groups and individuals who have structured their tax planning around the advantages historically offered by this jurisdiction.

One of the first legislative proposals focuses on the establishment of the Domestic Minimum Top-Up Tax (DMTT), aligned with OECD’s Pillar 2, which constitutes the centerpiece of the reform. With this measure, Uruguay joins the international trend of guaranteeing a minimum level of taxation of 15% for multinational groups meeting specific revenue thresholds. As seen, this entails reviewing the scope of traditional promotional regimes, such as free trade zones, the software industry promotion regime (Decree 150-007), or the Investment Promotion Law, which have been cornerstones of its policy to attract foreign capital.

Additionally, the reform proposes to deepen the country’s “shift toward a worldwide income system” through the expansion of taxation on foreign-source income for tax residents and the creation of a new “tax holiday” regime for those acquiring residence as of 2026. This generates a novel scenario in which the international mobility of high-net-worth individuals will need to reconsider the structuring of income, assets, and investment locations. This redesign pursues the dual purpose of strengthening domestic revenue collection while maintaining the country’s competitiveness in attracting new tax residents, following the trend initiated in recent years, whereby Uruguay has steadily moved toward adapting its tax system to a worldwide income approach.

Equally relevant are the adjustments to the regime of international postal shipments and the introduction of new rules on payment facilities, statute of limitations on tax debts, access to financial information, and the offsetting of tax credits, which modernize the relationship between taxpayers and the Uruguayan tax administration. Although operational in nature, these changes affect legal certainty and predictability in transactions, both of which are central factors in any cross-border tax planning strategy.

In sum, the projected package of measures reflects the Uruguayan State’s willingness to position itself as a fiscally cooperative jurisdiction, aligned with international standards of transparency and fairness, without renouncing its longstanding vocation to attract capital and investment. For taxpayers and tax advisors, this scenario requires a careful review of current structures and anticipation of the impacts these undeniably significant reforms will have on the design and execution of tax strategies in the region
