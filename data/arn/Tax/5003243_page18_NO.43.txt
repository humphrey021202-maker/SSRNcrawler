Abstract

This article compares the Portuguese and the Spanish simplified tax regimes (STRs) with regard to personal income taxation. In Portugal, the regime has become more equitable and increasingly uses information technology. In Spain, the modular regime is complex and could occasion evasion. Accordingly, Spain should consider abandoning its current STR.
