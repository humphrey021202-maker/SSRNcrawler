Abstract

This study investigates the effect of protectionist tariffs on firm performance, income tax payments, and investment among US firms. Using the US–China trade war and related Section 301 tariffs as a setting, I find that US firms paying these tariffs experience decreased firm performance while simultaneously increasing cash tax planning to presumably decrease their total cash burden to the government. I also find that impacted firms decrease capital expenditures and acquisitions, which may negatively impact future operating performance. Cross-sectional analyses confirm that these effects apply to domestic-only firms and are more pronounced for firms facing higher market competition. Further, I document firm responses in financial reporting including disclosures of tariff costs and mitigation strategies. Combined, these results provide timely evidence regarding consequences of an ongoing restrictive trade policy.

Keywords: US-China trade war, Section 301, tax payments, tariffs
