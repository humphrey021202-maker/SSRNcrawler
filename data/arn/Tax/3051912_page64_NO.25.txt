Abstract

We empirically investigate the impact of tax complexity on FDI at ﬁrm level, employing a large database of German multinational enterprises that is administrated by Deutsche Bundesbank. More precisely, we analyze the location choice of 4474 new German FDI projects in OECD countries from 2005 to 2009. The results suggest that tax complexity has a repressive eﬀect on FDI. Moreover, we ﬁnd that the magnitude of this eﬀect substantially depends on the level of the statutory corporate income tax rate.

Keywords: FDI, location choice, tax complexity

JEL Classification: F23, H25, H32
