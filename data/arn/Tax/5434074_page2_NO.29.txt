Abstract

The landscape of entrepreneurial finance has undergone significant transformation over the past two decades, driven by innovations such as crowdfunding, initial coin offerings (ICOs), and decentralized finance (DeFi). While these mechanisms expanded access to capital, they also introduced substantial risks, including fraud, governance failures, and regulatory backlash. This paper introduces Decentralized Autonomous Venture Capital (DAVC) as an emerging paradigm that combines decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) structures, tokenized governance, and algorithmic investment mechanisms to address persistent inefficiencies in entrepreneurial finance. Drawing on agency theory, institutional theory, the resource-based view, and game theory, the study proposes a conceptual framework for DAVC and compares it against traditional venture capital (VC) and ICO models.

The methodology is conceptual and exploratory, leveraging case insights from blockchain-native investment collectives such as MetaCartel Ventures and FlamingoDAO. Findings highlight that DAVCs offer three main contributions: (1) democratization of early-stage financing through decentralized decision-making, (2) enhanced transparency and accountability via smart contracts, and (3) global inclusivity for entrepreneurs in underfunded ecosystems. However, challenges related to governance capture, regulatory uncertainty, and smart contract vulnerabilities remain significant. The study concludes that DAVCs represent a disruptive frontier in entrepreneurial finance, requiring further empirical validation and regulatory experimentation.
