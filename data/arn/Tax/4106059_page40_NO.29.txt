Trade intertemporal reporting discrepancies: a puzzle

Abstract

I document a puzzling pattern in international trade in the European Union (EU): some transactions are reported in December by importers, while they are reported in January of the next year by exporters. I attempt but fail to understand whether this pattern results from innocuous measurement errors, or whether traders manipulate reporting for tax-saving purposes.

Keywords: Tax evasion, tax revenues, international trade, profit shifting, trade balance.

JEL Classification: H26, F14.
