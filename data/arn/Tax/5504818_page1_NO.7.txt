Abstract

This research examines Germany's tax and accounting system, focusing on the challenges and opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and international investors. The study highlights the complexity of the German multi-layered tax structure, including corporate tax, solidarity surcharge, trade tax, and value-added tax (VAT), and evaluates the dual accounting standards (HGB vs IFRS). Methodology: A descriptive-analytical approach is used, relying on secondary data from OECD, PwC, KPMG, BMWK, and official legal codes (KStG, GewStG, UStG). Comparative analysis and qualitative content review were applied. Key Findings: The effective corporate tax burden ranges from 30-33% depending on municipality. SMEs face high compliance costs but benefit from Germany's extensive tax treaty network (90+) and strong international reputation. Differences between HGB and IFRS reflect Germany's balance between domestic stability and global transparency. Critical Analysis: While Germany's tax system promotes transparency and fairness, it disproportionately increases compliance burdens for SMEs. This structural imbalance raises questions about whether current policies sufficiently address the unique challenges faced by smaller firms. Thus, taxation cannot be viewed in isolation but must be analyzed alongside non-tax factors such as infrastructure and labor markets. Conclusion: SMEs and investors should adopt digital accounting systems, optimize tax planning, and prepare for global initiatives such as the OECD Minimum Tax. Germany remains a competitive hub, but long-term success requires balancing fiscal responsibility with administrative efficiency. Transition: The following chapter (Introduction) will provide the background, problem statement, objectives, and research questions that guided this study. 

Keywords: German Taxation, SMEs, Trade Tax (Gewerbesteuer), HGB vs IFRS, International Taxation, Digitalization
