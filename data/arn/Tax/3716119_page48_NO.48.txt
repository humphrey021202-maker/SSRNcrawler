Abstract

This paper investigates the effect of firms’ investment in digitalization on tax-induced income
shifting. We put forward a novel, micro-level digitalization index based on a survey monitoring
European firms’ digital technology usage. Our index captures if firms have implemented up to
three key software solutions to digitally monitor and manage firm performance: Enterprise
resource planning (ERP) software, database management systems (DBMS) and groupware
software. We show that digitalization boosts tax-induced income shifting. We find that
communication between firms via groupware software seems to be a key enabler of tax
strategies to shift income. We instrument for investment in digitalization to mitigate potential
endogeneity concerns. Further, we show that digitalized firms promptly adjust reported profits
in response to income shifting incentive shocks. Overall, our findings suggest that digitalization
is a crucial foundation for timely, data-driven decision making in tax departments of
multinational corporations and increases support functions’ performance in terms of taxinduced
income shifting.

Keywords: Digitalization, Firm Performance, Digital Technology, Tax Planning, Income Shifting
