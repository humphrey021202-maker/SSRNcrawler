Abstract

On 30 September 2017, the United Kingdom implemented a powerful new investigative tool known as an “unexplained wealth order” in its Criminal Finances Act 2017. On 7-8 November 2017, London hosted the Fifth OECD Forum on Tax and Crime. Against this background, as well as other recent developments that have shown a spotlight on the interlinkages between tax and crime, this working paper researches the role that tax laws and tax authorities play in either helping or hindering unexplained wealth orders. In doing so, it derives some relevant considerations for United Kingdom authorities as they move forward in implementing this new law.

Keywords: Unexplained Wealth Orders, Tax and Crime, Anti-Corruption
