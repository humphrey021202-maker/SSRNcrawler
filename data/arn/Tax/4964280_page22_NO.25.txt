Abstract

The OECD's two-pillar solution addresses tax challenges from digitalisation, with Pillar Two’s Subject to Tax Rule (STTR) and GloBE rules ensuring minimum taxation. This article examines the STTR's application in Nigeria, exploring its implications and questioning its effectiveness for revenue generation, considering high implementation costs and Nigeria's strategic alternatives.
