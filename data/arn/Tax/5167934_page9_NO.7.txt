Abstract

This study investigates whether the accounting for uncertain tax positions (IFRIC 23) under a principles-based reporting standard curbs corporate tax avoidance across OECD and EU countries. IFRIC 23 provides guidance on recognition, measurement, and disclosure of uncertain tax positions in financial statements. Under this interpretation, firms must assume that tax authorities have full knowledge of the tax information reported in the financial statements. As the interpretation increases transparency, it is also expected to limit managerial discretion to exploit aggressive tax positions in financial reporting. Consistent with prediction, I find some evidence that IFRIC 23’s adoption decreases corporate tax avoidance. The effect strengthens in jurisdictions with higher tax audit intensity. However, I also document that affected firms, when I compared with U.S. firms subject to FIN 48, engage in more tax avoidance, indicating a weaker deterrent effect of IFRIC 23. Overall, this study offers insights that tax disclosure requirements under financial reporting can help curb corporate tax avoidance.

Keywords: IFRIC 23, tax avoidance, uncertain tax positions
