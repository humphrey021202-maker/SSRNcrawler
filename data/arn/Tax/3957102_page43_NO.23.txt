Abstract

Following some unsuccessful attempts, Italy has enacted a new digital services tax broadly in line with the European Commission’s DST Proposal. Targeted at selected digital services and large undertakings, the Italian levy shares the flaws of the Commission’s design. It also gives rise to further concerns as it deviates from the DST Proposal.

Keywords: Digital Services Tax, Value Creation, Sectoral Levy, Excise Tax, Gross-Receipt Taxes

JEL Classification: H25, K34
