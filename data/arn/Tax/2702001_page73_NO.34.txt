Abstract

Building on recent theory, we find strong and robust evidence that external labor market incentives motivate CEOs to adopt more aggressive tax policies in order to improve firm performance and their own labor market value. In addition, we find that the tax aggressiveness-labor market incentives relation varies in the cross-section consistently with theory. We find that the relation is attenuated in industries for which the CEO has more outside employment options, and we find it to be amplified in industries for which competition for CEO talent is likely greatest, and also among CEOs estimated to have greater ability. Overall, our results suggest that the market for CEOs – an incentive device external to the firm – has a meaningful impact on corporate tax policy.

Keywords: industry tournament incentives, market for CEO talent, corporate taxes, tax aggressiveness

Lagged market cap is computed as the natural logarithm of lagged total market value of equity (Compustat PRCC_F i,t-1 *CSHO i,t-1 ). Pretax foreign income equals pretax income from foreign operations (Compustat PIFO i,t ) divided by lagged total assets (Compustat AT i,t-1 ). Equity in earnings equals one if equity in earnings (Compustat ESUB i,t ) is positive. Intangibles equals reported intangibles (Compustat INTAN i,t ) divided by lagged total assets (Compustat AT i,t-1 ). Capital intensity equals net property, plant and equipment (Compustat PPENT i,t ) divided by lagged total assets (Compustat AT i,t ). Net operating loss is an indicator variable equal to one if the firm reports a positive tax loss carryforward during the year (Compustat TLCF i,t )

Free cash flow equals operating cash flow minus capital expenditures (Compustat OANCF i,t -CAPX i,t ) scaled by lagged total assets (Compustat ATi, t-1 ). Research and development equals total R&D expense divided by lagged assets (Compustat XRD i,t ). Tax haven equals one if the firm reports a material subsidiary in a known tax haven during the current and previous two fiscal years.
