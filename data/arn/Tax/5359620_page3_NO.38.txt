Abstract

Environmental taxation aims to improve firms' environmental performance by increasing the cost of polluting. Different from prior finding that firms in developed countries increase R&D investments in response to environmental taxes, we do not find more investment in green technologies by highly polluting Chinese firms or firms from provinces with higher environmental tax rates after the implementation of China's Environmental Protection Tax Law. Instead, these firms increase their income tax avoidance to offset the additional costs caused by the Environmental Protection Tax. This increase in tax avoidance is more pronounced for firms with greater financial constraints, firms in provinces with higher environmental tax rates and greater emphasis on environmental protection. While the environmental tax, on average, improves polluting firms' environmental performance, this effect is muted for firms that increase their income tax avoidance. Overall, our findings suggest that the role of environmental taxation in promoting environmental sustainability is undermined by Chinese firms' income tax avoidance. Our study provides important policymaking implications by identifying an unintended consequence of environmental taxation in emerging markets and showing how different taxes interact with each other.

Keywords: Environmental Taxation, Corporate Income Tax Avoidance, Environmental Sustainability
