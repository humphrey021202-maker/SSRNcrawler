Abstract

Objective: This study investigates the effect of tax litigation (TLit) on the cost of third-party capital (Kd) and equity capital (Ke) of companies listed on B3, considering financial and corporate governance variables. It addresses a literature gap by examining how tax disputes influence corporate financing decisions. Method: A panel data analysis of 174 B3-listed companies from 2017 to 2023 across various sectors was conducted using a fixed-effects econometric model to determine the impact of TLit on Kd and Ke. Results: The findings indicate that tax litigation significantly increases the cost of third-party capital (Kd), reflecting creditors' higher perceived fiscal risk. However, the equity capital (Ke) cost remains largely unaffected, suggesting that shareholders do not adjust return expectations based on tax-related litigation. Contributions: This research provides practical insights for corporate managers, investors, and regulators by offering empirical evidence on the relationship between tax litigation and capital costs. The study emphasizes the need for effective tax management to mitigate the adverse effects of tax disputes on debt financing and calls for future research to explore the intersection of tax litigation, governance, and financial performance across different market contexts.

Keywords: Tax Litigation, Cost of Capital, Corporate Governance, Fiscal Risk, B3 Listed Companies
