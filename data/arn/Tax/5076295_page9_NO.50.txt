Abstract

This study aims to explore the effectiveness of cross-border cooperation in reducing corporate tax avoidance, focusing on companies without subsidiaries in tax havens. Based on a literature review, despite various international initiatives like BEPS initiated by the OECD, tax avoidance remains a major challenge. Global companies use various techniques to shift profits to low-tax countries without establishing subsidiaries. This study finds that although international cooperation is crucial, gaps in implementation and inconsistent tax policies across countries hinder its effectiveness. Therefore, enhanced coordination among countries and more consistent enforcement of laws are necessary to significantly reduce tax avoidance.

Keywords: Cross-border cooperation, Tax avoidance, Global companies, Tax havens, International policy
