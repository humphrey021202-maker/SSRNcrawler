Abstract

We examine business responses to a minimum tax (MT) that prescribed fixed floors on corporate tax liability while permitting MT credit carryforwards. Using 2010–2020 tax-return data on all Slovak corporations, we find that many companies immediately relocated from reporting zero taxable income toward bunching at the new floors. We infer the elasticity of taxable income (ETI) to be between 0.33 and 2.28 across value-added tax (VAT) and turnover categories, and quantify the marginal efficiency burden (MEB) of the corporation tax. Given limited extensive-margin responses, our evidence suggests the MT reduced the overall efficiency burden while raising additional tax revenue.

Keywords: corporate income tax, elasticity, inter-temporal profit shifting, bunching, tax carry-forwards
