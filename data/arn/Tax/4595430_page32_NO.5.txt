Abstract

This paper examines the challenges faced by Indonesian businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic and assesses the efficacy of tax incentives in addressing these unprecedented issues. The research objectives include identifying the heterogeneity of obstacles, evaluating the role of tax incentives, and proposing evidence-based policy recommendations. In accordance with OECD (2012) and drawing on a representative sample of over 7,500 businesses across 34 provinces in Indonesia, this study employs a scale-based perception survey to investigate the efficacy of tax incentives. The findings uncover a diverse range of impediments, with reduced product demand emerging as the most pressing concern. Results suggest that larger businesses with a higher number of permanent employees tend to benefit more from tax incentives, underscoring the need for targeted incentives. Following Dunn (2018), our user-survey analysis reveals high interest in tax incentives across market share categories and revenue groups, indicating their perceived utility transcends these segments. Tax incentives exhibit a positive association with business performance during the pandemic, bolstering resilience and liquidity. The larger businesses demonstrated greater resilience during the pandemic. Nevertheless, businesses with mixed or international primary market shares do not produce statistically significant results, necessitating further exploration. Based on the findings, we propose the following policy recommendations: Implement tailored tax incentives catering to various business types, taking into account their industry and size; develop effective communication strategies to elucidate the benefits of these tax incentives; employ behavioural methodologies to design policies targeting specific business groups and enhance their participation levels; and conduct additional research to ascertain factors influencing resilience and barriers to tax incentives utilisation. By adopting these policy recommendations, policymakers can devise more targeted tax incentives supporting business resilience and economic recovery in Indonesia while addressing the dynamic impacts and risks faced by businesses amidst crises.
