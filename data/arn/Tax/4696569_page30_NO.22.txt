Abstract

Exit taxation can impose a significant tax and cash flow burden on multinational enterprises (MNEs) in their cross-border operations, as it taxes unrealized capital gains. Using country-level data on newly established MNE subsidiaries in the European Union, I investigate the effect of exit taxation and the inherent cash flow aspect on MNEs’ greenfield investments for the period 2005-2019. The event study design with dynamic treatment estimation shows that exit taxation negatively affects greenfield investments by significantly reducing the annual growth rate of newly established subsidiaries per country with a lag of one year. On average, this results in about 123 fewer new subsidiaries in the EU per year and about 1,845 fewer over the entire observation period. By analyzing three exit tax payment methods, I also find that switching to less cash flow-burdening exit tax payment provisions increases greenfield investments in the following year. This result is mainly due to abolitions of immediate payment provisions, which represent the largest cash flow burden for taxpayers. My findings show that MNEs anticipate the potential exit costs of entering a new market and consider future cash flow aspects in their greenfield investment decisions.
