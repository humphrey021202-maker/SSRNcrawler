Abstract

In this article, the author discusses the new e-commerce rules in the field of VAT, as a consequence of the entry into force on 1 July 2021 of the VAT Package, which includes Council Directive (EU) 2017/2455 and Council Directive (EU) 2019/1995. He welcomes the new provisions on e-commerce, but highlights that VAT is still threatened by new challenges caused by globalization and by existing realities that have not yet been sufficiently tackled. The author adopts a practical approach in this article, which aims to highlight some of his key concerns.
