Abstract

Introduction Tax litigation represents a significant issue within Brazil's complex regulatory framework, characterized by frequent legislative changes and uncertainty. Identifying determinants that influence litigation risk is essential. Research Problem and Objective This study aims to analyze the impact of corporate characteristics-size, age, debt level, complexity, governance standards, and sectoral affiliation-on Brazilian firms' tax litigation risk. Theoretical Framework The research is anchored in corporate governance theory and financial economics literature, highlighting how governance structures, financial characteristics, and industry contexts affect firms' litigation propensity. Methodology Using multinomial logistic regression, this study analyzed 3,290 firm-year observations of Brazilian listed companies (B3, 2009-2023) to assess factors influencing their propensity for tax litigation. Results Analysis Results show reduced litigation risk among larger, older firms, while higher leverage, Novo Mercado listing, and operation in historically litigious sectors significantly elevate litigation propensity. Conclusion: Tax litigation risk in Brazil is shaped by a complex interplay of internal characteristics (size, age, leverage) and external factors (sectoral risk, governance visibility), with implications for risk management. Contribution/Impact The study provides empirical insights for improving managerial practices and regulatory policies aimed at reducing litigation risk, enhancing compliance, and promoting legal certainty in Brazil.

Keywords: Tax Litigation, Corporate Governance, Financial Leverage
