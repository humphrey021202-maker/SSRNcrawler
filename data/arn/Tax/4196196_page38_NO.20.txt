Abstract

This study examined IAS 12 implementation and listed firms deferred taxes in different accounting regimes. A z-score analysis is used to compare pre and post deferred taxes and the explanatory variables. The final analysis includes a T-Test and pooled ordinary least square regression that tests the relationships among the covariates. The deferred tax values between pre and post-IAS 12 adoption are significantly different. This suggests that IAS 12 affects the value of deferred taxes. The variation between the deferred taxes pre and post-IAS 12 is associated with the values of assets, liabilities and revenue. Earlier studies have discussed several issues associated with deferred taxes such as measurement, income and expenses recognition and their effects on deferred tax values while this research focused on how IAS 12 unintendedly addresses an intractable issue between tax and accounting rules by examining how well deferred taxes reduce or increase following IAS 12 adoption.
