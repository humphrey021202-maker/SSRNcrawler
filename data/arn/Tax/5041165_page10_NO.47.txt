Abstract

This paper aims to analyse the provisions introduced by the Italian Law on 29 December 2022, n. 197(Budget Law 2023), para. 96-99 of Art. 1, intended to make the tax treatment of capital gains realized by non-residents arising from the indirect sale of Italian immovable property equivalent to the one applicable to their direct sale. This newly introduced provision aligns the domestic tax regime with the one provided by Art. 13, para. 4, of the OECD Model Tax Convention, and by Art. 9, para. 4, of the Multilateral Convention To Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures To Prevent Base Erosion And Profit Shifting ("MLI"), which has been signed, but not yet ratified, by Italy.

Keywords: Tax Law, Capital Gains, Italy, Real Estate
