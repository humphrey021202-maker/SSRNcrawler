Abstract

This paper examines the most direct method to curb European profit shifting: an EU-wide adoption of unitary taxation. Using country-by-country reporting data, we estimate country-level revenue changes when taxable profits are distributed based on different formulas measuring economic activity. We find that tax revenues would increase for most EU members. While some countries-in particular the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Ireland, and Malta-may incur losses, these can be offset by adopting an effective national top-up tax, consistent with the EU's plan to introduce a minimum corporate tax of 15%. Our findings indicate that unitary taxation would not only restore fair competition and significantly boost EU-wide tax revenues-ranging from US$ 24.1 to US$ 26.8 billion in isolation or US$ 34.5 to US$ 35.4 billion when combined with the minimum tax-but is also politically feasible: When coupled with the minimum corporate tax, no member state would lose from its implementation.

Keywords: corporate tax, unitary taxation, minimum corporate tax
