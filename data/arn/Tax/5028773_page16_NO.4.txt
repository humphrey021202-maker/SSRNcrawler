Abstract

This note presents a case decided by the French Supreme Administrative Court on 4 October 2021. The main takeaway from the decision is that profit allocation needs to be based on a precise functional analysis. This means, in particular, that the use of the term ?principal entrepreneur?, in practice, is irrelevant in determining whether or not a company should be allocated a residual profit or loss. Also, specific risks may justify temporary reduced profitability in certain instances.
