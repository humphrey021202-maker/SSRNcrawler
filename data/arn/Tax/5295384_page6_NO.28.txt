Abstract

This paper examines a recent episode in Canadian tax administration where the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) began enforcing budget-announced capital gains inclusion changes before legislative enactment. The episode, which affected trust allocations and year-end crystallizations, reveals systemic tensions between legislative authority and administrative action. While the CRA justified its anticipatory enforcement as necessary for compliance readiness, this practice left taxpayers and advisors in a legal grey zone—subject to obligations not yet codified in law.

Relying on principles drawn from Hickman Motors, Re Eurig Estate, Canada Trustco, and Venne, this paper argues that taxpayers are entitled to legal certainty, not mere administrative expectations. It further critiques the CRA’s position through the lens of judicial review, citing Khanna and North Shore Power, and proposes reforms including statutory amendments to limit guidance to post-enactment periods.

Ultimately, this paper highlights how provisional enforcement—though framed as practical—risks undermining the rule of law. When tax liabilities hinge on announcements rather than enacted law, both public trust and professional integrity are at stake. The analysis concludes with a call for Parliament to legislate administrative boundaries and expand taxpayer recourse in the pre-assessment stage.
