Abstract

Global carbon pricing has often been portrayed as an interesting idea that will never be implemented due to political hurdles. Yet, this description is being challenged: growing political support for climate clubs suggests that a global carbon price might become reality in the future. This article investigates the conditions for the adoption and implementation of a climate club based on a global carbon price by comparing it to the international corporate tax club created by Pillar Two, which was also described as politically impossible a few years ago. This comparison highlights that establishing a climate club will require addressing design issues and institutional obstacles that might be even more complex than those that characterized the negotiations of the global anti-base erosion (GloBE) rules.

Keywords: Climate club, carbon border adjustment measures, global carbon price, GloBE rules, Pillar Two, inclusive forum on carbon mitigation approaches
