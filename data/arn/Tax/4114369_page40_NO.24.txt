Abstract

We study how profit taxation affects plants' R&D spending and innovation activities. Relying on geocoded survey panel data which approximately covers the universe of R&D-active plants in Germany, we exploit around 7,300 changes in the municipal business tax rate over the period 19872013 for identification. Applying event study models, we find a negative and statistically significant effect of an increase in profit taxation on plants' R&D spending with an implied long-run elasticity of −1.25. Reductions in R&D are particularly strong among more credit-constrained plants. In contrast, homogeneity of effects across the plant size distribution questions policy makers common practice to link targeted R&D tax incentives to plant size. We further find lagged negative effects on the (citation-weighted) number of filed patents.

Keywords: corporate taxation, firms, R&D, innovation, patents

Multiplying the GDP-innovation elasticity of 0.006 with the firm-level tax elasticity of patents (0.87) and the average relative tax change (5.3%), we calculate a long-run loss of 0.03% in GDP for each one percentage point increase in the local business tax. This tax-induced reduction in plants' innovation on local growth amounts to around eight percent of the total negative effect of an LBT increase on local GDP (see Figure 8, Panel B), falling in the range of estimates by Posted: 2017
