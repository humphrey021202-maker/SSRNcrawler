Abstract

Australia’s indirect tax policies for wine, the Wine Equalisation Tax (WET) and the WET rebate are very different to the policies of ‘old world’ wine countries and emerging competitors, and industry leaders have identified these tax policies as stymieing the industry. In light of these concerns and the current tax reform enquiry this paper critiques Australia’s wine taxes and evaluates reform options. This paper supports the repeal of the WET. The WET (as well as the wine excise alternative) raise small amounts of tax revenue but damage economic efficiency, fail to target externalities (the wine abusers), appear inequitable and are too complex, particularly for the thousands of small wine producers. Without a WET, it follows that the WET rebate also needs to be repealed, as it is costly, inefficient and inequitable. Assistance would be needed to help those affected by the transition away from a WET.

Keywords: Wine equalisation tax, Wine equalisation tax rebate, sales tax, tax policy, GST
