Abstract

This paper examines how regulations mandating environmental, social, and governance (ESG) disclosure affect an important dimension of a firm’s financial decision, namely its tax payments. Using a difference-in-differences analysis on a sample of firms from 48 countries, we find that ESG disclosure mandates lead to significant reductions in tax 
avoidance, with stronger effects for mandates that include tax-relevant components. We identify increases in ESG information transparency and improvements in firms’ ESG 
performance as channels through which ESG disclosure mandates reduce tax avoidance. We further find that the decrease in tax avoidance following ESG disclosure mandates is more pronounced in countries with weaker financial disclosure requirements, weaker legal and tax enforcement, and weaker environmental and social institutions. Collectively, the evidence suggests that non-financial disclosure regulations can curb aggressive tax behavior, supporting broader goals of corporate accountability and sustainable development. 

Keywords: Tax Avoidance, ESG, Disclosure, Institutional Environments, Corporate Governance
