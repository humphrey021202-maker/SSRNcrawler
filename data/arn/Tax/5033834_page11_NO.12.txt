Abstract

We investigate how firms respond to statutory tax rate increases imposed on their industry peers, leveraging a unique policy change in Korea. In 2018, a new top corporate tax bracket raised rates for a subset of firms, generating two types of unaffected firms: those indirectly affected through shifts in competitive dynamics and those entirely unaffected. Using a difference-in-differences (DID) analysis on the sample of unaffected firms, we find that those indirectly affected by their peers’ higher tax rates significantly increase capital investment. These firms also experience subsequent gains in sales growth, market share, and profitability. Importantly, we show that the presence of such strategic peer responses—a violation of the Stable Unit Value Treatment Assumption (SUTVA)—can bias estimates of tax effects on corporate investment among targeted firms in standard DID models. Overall, this study provides evidence on how tax policies with heterogeneous effects influence competitive dynamics, offering valuable insights into their broader implications.

Keywords: strategic response, corporate investment, competitive dynamics, externalities, tax policy, corporate tax rate increase, fixed assets, industry peers
