Abstract

This paper explores India's Equalisation Levy (EL), a 2% tax on digital transactions of non-resident companies, introduced to address revenue loss due to the digital economic system and its latest abolition. While the EL aimed to create a level playing field and garner higher revenue, it faced criticism for developing additional compliance burdens, doubtlessly impacting startups, and raising concerns about double taxation. The US, representing important tech organisations suffering from the EL, strongly contested the levy, threatening a retaliatory tax on Indian entities. This highlighted the want for a global consensus on digital taxation.
