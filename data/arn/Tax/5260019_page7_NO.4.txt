Abstract

This article outlines the content and limits of the duty to protect the European Union’s financial interests regarding tax-based own resources, specifically customs duties and VAT, which are essential for financing the EU budget. It addresses the responsibilities of EU Member States to ensure that these resources are available to the Union and to combat fraud and other illegal activities that affect their effective collection.

Simultaneously, these duties must be performed in accordance with the protection of fundamental rights. The balance achieved between collection effectiveness, the division of competences between the EU and Member States, and the safeguarding of fundamental rights, as drawn by the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice, is also critically examined.

The paper is reprinted from Intertax 52(8/9): 533-549 (2024).

Keywords: EU financial interests, own resources decision, custom duties, VAT, fraud, EU charter of fundamental rights, constitutional rights, EU Law primacy, Åkerberg Fransson, Taricco, Euro Box, Lin
