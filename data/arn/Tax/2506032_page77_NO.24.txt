Abstract

Financial derivatives play an increasingly common role in corporate tax avoidance. This paper takes a descriptive approach to answer the fundamental, yet under explored, questions of why derivatives are useful for corporate tax avoidance and how they fulfill this objective. To evaluate why, I develop and discuss a simple framework of research, practical issues, and anecdotes about derivatives-based tax avoidance. I then provide unique insight into how derivatives reduce taxes by discussing the complex transaction-level detail of two derivatives-based tax planning strategies. Finally, I identify potential issues that might be addressed in future research. Overall, by discussing the concepts and mechanics of derivatives-based tax avoidance, this study serves as a prologue to extant and future research on the topic.

Keywords: financial instruments, derivatives, tax avoidance, tax shelter
