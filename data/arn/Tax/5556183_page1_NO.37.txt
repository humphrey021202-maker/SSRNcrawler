Abstract

The transfer pricing (TP) landscape is dominated by cross-border transactions. This article discusses the relevance of domestic transfer pricing (DTP), including potential base erosion from interaction with cross-border transactions. The authors examine the interplay of DTP with GloBE rules and make suggestions for improving DTP regulations, based on an analysis of regimes around the world.
