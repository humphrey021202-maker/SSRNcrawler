Abstract

In this article, Narotzki explores the significant shortfalls in President Trump’s economic policies over the past several months, emphasizing their dependence on historically ineffective strategies and argues that Trump’s economic proposals are driven more by political motivations than by coherent economic strategic objectives and could leave the country more exposed to geopolitical risks and economic volatility.
