Abstract

The recently finalized regulations in T.D. 10022 and the proposed regulation in REG-107420-24 reflect thought, care, logic, and thoroughness.

This comment letter on T.D. 10022 and REG--107420-24 covers a number of areas mostly related to the sourcing of income from the sale of digital copies and the provision of cloud services. In particular, there is discussion of the need to make clear when sales will be covered by either of sections 861(a)(6)/862(a)(6) (purchase and resale) and 863(b) (production and sale). Also, discussion also focuses on the anti-abuse rule of Reg. section 1.861-18(f)(2)(ii).

Regarding cloud services, the new rule presently only covers income from defined "cloud transactions". The suggestion is made that other income items earned through electronic mediums should also be sourced under the new sourcing rule in Prop. Reg. section 1.861-19(d). Another major issue discussed is the critical need for the new sourcing method to be applied not on a "taxpayer-by-taxpayer approach" as proposed, but rather on a "unitary approach". In the event that future finalized regulations do not adopt a "unitary approach" and instead retain the "taxpayer-by-taxpayer approach", the submission recommends the adoption of a look-through rule that would be the next best alternative to avoid the nonsensical results that the "taxpayer-by-taxpayer approach" causes. The submission also recommends expansion of the anti-abuse rule in Prop. Reg. section 1.861-19(d)(9).
