Abstract

This paper reviews Oracle Corporation’s transfer pricing cost sharing arrangement based on forensic economic analysis of public information and U.S. tax regulations, including U.S. and foreign financial reporting, presentations by and meetings with employees and executives that work in its tax department, its operational and foreign sales organizations, and comments made by senior executives in interviews and other published sources. This report finds that Oracle Corporation appears to have violated various U.S. tax codes and the U.S. international tax and transfer pricing regulations beginning in years prior to 2009 to the present, in ways that caused its transfer pricing cost sharing arrangement with its foreign affiliates to have failed to transition to the 2009 regulations with a waiver from a periodic adjustment. This appears to make its foreign pretax income reported in Ireland and other foreign locations taxable in the U.S. as a result of a periodic adjustment and as effectively connected income. However, the Internal Revenue Service has never to date enforced the cost sharing periodic adjustment regulations at any taxpayer, and have also awarded Oracle with at least three Advanced Pricing Agreements (APAs) which are contracts that Oracle has described as blocking the IRS from enforcing U.S. tax laws with respect to the covered intercompany transactions with foreign affiliates. The identified periodic adjustment is not limited by any statute of limitations as long as Oracle Corporation continues to use the intangible assets that were covered by its cost sharing arrangement. This tax risk has not to the author’s knowledge been reflected in its SEC filings or reserves for uncertain tax positions reported in its annul Form 10-K filings.
