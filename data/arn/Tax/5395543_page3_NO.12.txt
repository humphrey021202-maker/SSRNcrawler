A Critical Appreciation of International Tax Law (in India)

Abstract

This is a transcript of Dr. Janssen-Sanghavi's lecture at the Bombay Bar Association (Bombay High Court) delivered on 14 June 2025. In this case, Janssen-Sanghavi examines critically a number of tax treaty cases decided by courts and tribunals in India. These include the Supreme Court's decisions in Nestlé and Engineering Analysis, the Andhra Pradesh High Court's judgement in Sanofi Pasteur, the Delhi High Court's judgement in New Skies Satellite, and the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal's decision in Hyosung Corporation. 

The author argues why a number of these are reasoned inadequately, and how courts in India may profit from an "evidence-based interpretation", rather than what he labels as "rhetorical interpretation". He concludes that despite many cases decided by Indian courts, the current state of tax treaty interpretation in India is in greyscale, rather than in black or white.

Keywords: tax treaties, international tax, Bombay High Court, litigation, case law, interpretation
