Abstract

The Multilateral Instrument (MLI) has a relevant impact on tax treaty measures concerning transfer pricing and the arm’s length principle (ALP). This article examines the incidence of five MLI provisions on transfer pricing that pose significantly interrelated issues, specifically, the saving clause of Article 11(1), the preamble enclosed in Article 6(1) expressing the will to eliminate double taxation without creating opportunities for reduced taxation through tax evasion or avoidance enshrined in the principal purpose test of Article 7(1), the corresponding adjustment provision of Article 17(1), and the mutual agreement provisions envisaged in Article 16.

Note: “Reprinted from INTERTAX, Volume 49, Issue 10, 2021, 803-827, with permission of Kluwer Law International.”

Keywords: MLI, multilateral instrument, tax treaties, transfer pricing, arm’s length principle, abuse, corresponding adjustments, mutual agreement procedure, MAP
