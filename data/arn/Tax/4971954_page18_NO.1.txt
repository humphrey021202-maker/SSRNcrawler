Will Congress’s Marijuana Tax Die an Administrative Death?

2 Pages Posted: 14 Nov 2024

Pat Oglesby

Center for New Revenue

Date Written: September 16, 2024

Abstract

Today’s sellers of marijuana can deduct only the cost of goods sold on federal income tax returns — thanks to section 280E, an obscure drug war law from 1982.  However, bypassing Congress, by marijuana’s administrative transfer to drug Schedule III, the Biden administration may let marijuana sellers deduct selling expenses as other businesses do.  It would be sad to see Congress’s pro-public-health, revenue-positive section 280E selling expense tax die. However, marijuana’s transfer to Schedule II instead of Schedule III would keep the marijuana selling expense tax revenue coming in and would keep section 280E’s unfinished tax experiment running.

Keywords: cannabis, marijuana, hemp, THC, tax, excise

That joint-rolling part of their work is production, not selling, so some of their hourly pay arguably goes into deductible COGS rather than into nondeductible selling costs. And section 280E is much easier to administer in jurisdictions that force marijuana commerce to stand apart from other commerce in dedicated marijuana stores
Section 280E may encourage weird workarounds like retailers having cashiers slowly roll joints when idle
