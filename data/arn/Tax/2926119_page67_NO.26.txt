Abstract

The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, referred to as FATCA, does not operate in a global tax vacuum. It is nearly impossible to comprehend fully its impact unless its highly technical procedural provisions are viewed in context. This introductory chapter will provide certain background information necessary to understand FATCA, its offspring like the OECD's CRS, and the impact of these initiatives.

FATCA's ostensible purpose was to act as an additional tax revenue source to offset additional spending in the HIRE Act of 2010. FATCA was passed on the unsubstantiated basis that “each year, the United States loses an estimated $100 billion in tax revenue due to offshore tax abuses.” However, the total amount of the offset revenue from FATCA was only projected to $8.714 billion for the ten year period of 2010 to 2020. This chapter explores the revenue raised until 2017 and the offsetting compliance costs.

This chapter also explores various tax pundits allegation that the United States operates as the largest tax haven in the world for individual wealth and that U.S. tax policy for individuals is directed to encourage capital inflow and discourage capital outflow. Support for this allegation includes that approximately 88% of income paid to non-residents did not attract withholding in 2013. U.S. states do not collect beneficial ownership information of U.S. companies. The U.S. has not agreed to globally exchange information pursuant to the OECD's CRS.

The costs of FATCA range from hundreds of millions of dollars to billions. 236 Other studies suggest that the estimated implementation costs of FATCA can amount to upwards of $235 million per institution. 237 A representative of the Tax Department of BBVA, the second largest bank in Spain, stated in a conference held in Valencia (Spain) in October 2013 that compliance costs could range from EUR 8 million for a local entity to EUR 800 million for a global entity. 238 The recent cost estimate of the U.K. Revenue for U.K. financial institutions is a one-off cost, even considering the IGA, of approximately £900 million-£1,600 million, with an ongoing cost of £50 million-£90 million a year. 239 55 percent of financial institutions surveyed by Thomson Reuters responded that they expected to exceed their original budget for FATCA compliance and only 35 percent found that they expected to remain within the original budget
KPMG and Deloitte have estimated that FFIs will encounter high costs for compliance with FATCA. Their studies indicate that over 250,000 FFIs will be affected by FATCA. The affected institutions will include investment firms, brokers, and banks among other financial institutions Posted: 2011-09-26
