Abstract

This study examines the impact of demonetization on tax evasion in India. Through a comprehensive analysis of data and literature review, the study evaluates the effectiveness of demonetization measures in curbing tax evasion practices. The research employs both qualitative and quantitative methods to assess changes in tax compliance behaviours post-demonetization. Findings indicate a mixed impact, with some sectors experiencing a reduction in tax evasion while others demonstrate resilience or adaptation to the new measures. The study discusses the implications of these findings for policy-makers and suggests strategies for enhancing tax enforcement mechanisms in the post-demonetization era.This study investigates the repercussions of demonetization on tax evasion dynamics within the Indian economy. Utilising a blend of empirical analysis and theoretical frameworks, it delves into the immediate and enduring effects of demonetization on tax compliance behaviours across various sectors and demographic segments. Through a meticulous examination of primary and secondary data sources, the study identifies shifts in tax evasion patterns and explores the underlying factors driving these changes.  The findings shed light on the nuanced relationship between demonetization and tax evasion, offering valuable insights for policymakers aiming to bolster tax enforcement strategies and foster greater fiscal integrity in India.

Keywords: Black money, underground economy, shadow economy, liquidity, currency.
