Abstract

Over the last decade, metal streams have evolved as a popular and tax-effective source of financing for Canadian mining companies. This article considers the principal features of the typical metal stream transaction that are relevant from a tax perspective. The focus is on the common situation of a Canadian parent company owning a non-Canadian mining property through a foreign affiliate, and selling a metal stream based on the future production from that foreign affiliate's mining property.

Keywords: metal streams, mining company, precious metal, streaming transactions, Canadian foreign affiliate

JEL Classification: K34
