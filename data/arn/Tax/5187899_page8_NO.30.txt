Abstract

This study explores the impact that tax disputes have on several characteristics of audit opinions for firms listed on Brazil's B3 exchange. Using comprehensive fixed effects panel data analysis of 233 companies across many industries from 2009 to 2023, totaling 3,241 observations, we investigate the relationship between tax litigation and structural attributes of audit reports. Tax litigation is measured as the proportion of tax provisions and contingent liabilities to total assets, while audit opinions are assessed through length, tone, readability, and technical complexity. Our findings reveal a nuanced link between tax risk and auditor reporting habits. Companies facing higher tax litigation receive notably shorter audit opinions that paradoxically exhibit greater clarity while incorporating more technical details. This suggests that auditors strategically customize their reporting approach when evaluating entities with elevated tax exposure-providing more precise, accessible information while including adequate technical specifics to address complex tax issues. The study also identifies other significant determinants of audit opinion characteristics, such as firm size, asset composition, business risk, and corporate governance mechanisms. The research makes several contributions to accounting literature and practice. First, it establishes tax disputes as a previously understudied yet meaningful factor shaping audit reports in Brazil. Second, it demonstrates how auditors balance disclosure thoroughness with legal protection when navigating tax-uncertain environments. Third, it provides evidence that effective tax risk administration may enhance financial reporting transparency. These findings hold important implications for multiple stakeholders: managers should prioritize tax compliance and governance to mitigate reporting complexities; regulators could consider streamlining Brazil's notoriously intricate tax codes to decrease litigation and related compliance costs; and auditors should maintain rigorous documentation practices when evaluating high tax risk clients.

Keywords: Tax litigation, Audit opinions, Corporate governance, Financial transparency
