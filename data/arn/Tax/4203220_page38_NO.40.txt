Does Statutory Incidence Matter for Tax Avoidance?

Abstract

This paper examines whether statutory incidence affects tax avoidance by homeowners. To this end, I exploit the unique setting of residential property taxation in Belgium, where homeowners can qualify for a reduction in the indirect transaction tax and the direct property tax by appealing their property tax base. This appeal behavior can thus act as a proxy for the homeowners' efforts to avoid these taxes. I find that homeowners are more likely to file an appeal if this can lead to a reduction in the transaction tax owed by future buyers of their property.

Keywords: Statutory incidence, Beliefs, Tax avoidance, Tax misperceptions, Fiscal illusion
