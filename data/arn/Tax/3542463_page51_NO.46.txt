Wealth Taxes and Capital Markets

16 Pages Posted: 10 Mar 2020

John D. Stowe

Ohio University

Date Written: February 21, 2020

Abstract

Wealth taxes have been adopted or considered as an adjunct to existing tax systems such as income taxes, property taxes, and consumption taxes. Discussions about a wealth tax are usually a mixture of political, social, and economic issues, with many of the published papers designed to serve an author’s agenda. The purpose of this note is to leave many of these issues behind and to focus on the effects of a wealth tax on capital markets.

Keywords: Wealth taxes, Equity valuation, Bond valuation

JEL Classification: G12, H20, H22
