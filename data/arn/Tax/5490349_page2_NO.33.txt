Abstract

This case study reviews the facts of Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter, Inc. The case presents an opportunity to reinforce the student’s understanding of the complex US corporate reorganization provisions. The case study leads to the question: What were the US tax and non-tax consequences of Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter for Twitter, Twitter’s shareholders, and Elon Musk?

This case presents an opportunity for exploration of the tax and non-tax consequences of a corporate acquisition transaction in the public company arena.
