Developing Country Revenue Mobilisation - A Proposal to Modify the ‘Transactional Net Margin’ Transfer Pricing Method

19 Pages Posted: 13 Feb 2018

Michael C. Durst

Institute of Development Studies (IDS), Brighton - International Centre for Tax and Development

Date Written: January 2016

Abstract

Developing countries tend to rely more heavily than wealthier countries on corporate tax revenue from multinational companies operating in their jurisdiction. Therefore, the practice that the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has labelled ‘base erosion and profit shifting’ (BEPS) – the diversion of taxable income by multinational groups from countries where they conduct business to other, zero- and low-tax countries – poses an especially challenging problem for developing countries.

Keywords: transfer pricing; developing countries; OECD; transactional net margin method (TNMM); base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS)
