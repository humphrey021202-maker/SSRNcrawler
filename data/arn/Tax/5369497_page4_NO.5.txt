Abstract

This paper examines the critical need for a robust dispute resolution mechanism under Pillar Two of the OECD's GloBE rules, which usher in a new era of international corporate tax. While the GloBE rules operate as a "common approach" without a binding multilateral convention, their uncoordinated application and interpretation across jurisdictions are highly likely to generate significant tax controversies and double taxation. The OECD acknowledges this, yet concrete guidance on dispute resolution remains elusive. The paper classifies potential GloBE disputes into "internal" (e.g., conflicts over GloBE income calculation or UTPR allocation) and "external" (e.g., clashes with existing tax treaty principles like the arm's length principle). It analyzes various proposals for dispute resolution, focusing on the Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP) under bilateral tax treaties. While MAP offers a familiar framework, its limitations include incomplete treaty networks, the absence of legislative MAP clauses in many treaties, and its inherent opaqueness, which hinders dispute prevention. Alternative approaches, such as domestic law mechanisms based on reciprocity (as seen in Italy) and a dedicated multilateral convention for GloBE MAP, are also explored. While a dedicated dispute resolution mechanism in a multilateral convention is deemed preferable for its comprehensive scope and potential for transparency, its political feasibility remains a significant hurdle. The paper concludes that without a cogent and legally authoritative dispute resolution mechanism, the "coordinated unilateralism" of the GloBE regime may struggle to deliver the necessary legal certainty for taxpayers amidst inevitable cross-border tax controversies.
