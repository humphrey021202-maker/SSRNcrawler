Abstract

As firms lower innovative investment in response to FASB Interpretation Number 48 (FIN 48), they choose between reallocating those funds to non-innovative investment, not change non-innovative investment, or lower non-innovative investment. Using a difference-in-differences research design, I provide evidence of the latter outcome. I also show that the results persist each year following FIN 48, are consistent across both types of non-innovative investment, and are more prominent among firms with declining R&D and among firms not previously under continuous audit. I also provide evidence that these effects are mitigated when managers have greater incentives to reallocate investment. My findings respond to Blouin and Robinson’s (2014) call to understand the real effects of FIN 48 by providing evidence that it lowers firms’ incentives for non-innovative investment.

Keywords: FIN48, non-innovative investment, capital expenditures, mergers and acquisitions, tax disclosure

JEL Classification: H25, G31, G32, M41
