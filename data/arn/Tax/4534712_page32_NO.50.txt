Abstract

We study the economic consequences of anti-loss trafficking rules, which disallow the use of loss carry-forwards as tax shield after a substantial ownership change. We use staggered changes to these rules in the EU27 Member States, Norway, and the United Kingdom from 1998 to 2019 and find that limiting the transfer of tax losses reduces the number of M&A by 18%. The impairment is driven by loss-making targets. Turning to the broader impact on industry dynamics, we find decreases in survival rates of young companies in response to tighter regulations. Some of these start-up deaths are compensated by new firm entrants. Loosening of regulation spurs firm entry and survival. Finally, tightening (loosening) anti-loss trafficking rules impairs (increases) industry productivity, especially for R&D-intensive industries that are more prone to loss-making in their life cycle. This is driven by anti-loss trafficking rules muting deal synergies and risk-taking.

Keywords: Mergers and acquisitions, anti-loss trafficking rules, taxes, market entry, market exit, innovation, industry performance

JEL Classification: G34, G38, H25
