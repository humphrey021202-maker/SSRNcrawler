Abstract

We examine how accounting-related investments in artificial intelligence (AI) relate to firm-level demand for accounting labor and to accounting work outcomes. We identify accounting-related AI investments using public firms’ job market postings. We first document that accounting-related AI investments increased markedly in recent years. These investments span all accounting subfields (audit, financial, managerial, and tax) and concentrate in faster growing and more intangible-intensive firms. Firms investing in accounting-related AI demand significantly fewer accounting skills in the labor market and hire marginally fewer traditional accountants. Despite accounting-related AI investments negatively relating to accounting hiring, they positively relate to improvements in some accounting-role-specific outcomes, such as 10-K filing speeds. However, accounting-related AI investments do not relate to more extreme and high-impact outcomes, such as restatements. We conclude that accounting-related AI investment reduces demand for traditional accountants and accounting skills but does not lead to worse accounting work outcomes. Examining a source of plausibly exogenous variation based on university AI graduates supports this conclusion.

Keywords: Artificial intelligence, accounting skills, accounting labor, labor, machine learning JEL classification: J20
