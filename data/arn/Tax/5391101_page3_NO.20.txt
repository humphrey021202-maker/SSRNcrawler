Abstract

This research explores advanced techniques for detecting deepfake content in both audio and video formats, addressing the growing challenge of synthetic media manipulation. The purpose of the study is to develop robust detection methods capable of identifying deepfakes with high accuracy, thereby enhancing media authenticity verification. Utilizing a combination of deep learning architectures, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for visual data and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for audio sequences, the methodology involves training on large datasets of genuine and manipulated samples. Key findings demonstrate that multi-modal detection models integrating audiovisual cues significantly outperform unimodal approaches, achieving improved detection rates and reduced false positives. The study underscores the importance of synchronized audio-video analysis in countering increasingly sophisticated deepfake generation techniques.

Keywords: Detecting Deepfake Content, Advanced Techniques, Deep Learning Architectures
