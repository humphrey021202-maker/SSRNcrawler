Abstract

In this CFE Opinion Statement, submitted to the EU Institutions in September 2021, the CFE ECJ Task Force comments on the ECJ decision in Société Générale (Case C-403/19), which reinforces established case law that EU law neither prohibits juridical double taxation nor does it put an obligation on the residence Member State to prevent the disadvantages that could arise from the exercise of competence thus attributed by the two Member States.
