Abstract

The concept of tax residence is a fundamental principle in determining an individual's or entity's tax liability within a jurisdiction. In Nigeria, the rules of residence play a crucial role in the administration of personal income tax, corporate taxation, and international tax compliance. This study critically examines the applicability of the rules of residence under the Nigerian tax regime, analyzing their effectiveness, challenges, and alignment with international best practices. The research explores statutory provisions such as the Personal Income Tax Act (PITA), the Companies Income Tax Act (CITA), and relevant provisions of the Finance Act, assessing their implications for individuals, businesses, and multinational corporations operating within Nigeria. It further investigates how residency rules affect tax obligations, double taxation treaties, and tax avoidance strategies. Employing a doctrinal research methodology, the study analyzes statutory provisions, case law, and international tax principles to evaluate the clarity, consistency, and enforceability of Nigeria's tax residency rules. Findings reveal that ambiguities in determining tax residency status often led to legal uncertainties, tax evasion, and enforcement challenges. Additionally, the study identifies gaps in Nigeria's tax laws concerning digital businesses and expatriate taxation. Recommendations include legislative reforms to clarify residency definitions, strengthening enforcement mechanisms, and adopting global best practices to ensure an equitable and efficient tax system. The study concludes that a well-defined and effectively implemented residency framework is essential for enhancing tax compliance, increasing government revenue, and promoting economic growth in Nigeria.
