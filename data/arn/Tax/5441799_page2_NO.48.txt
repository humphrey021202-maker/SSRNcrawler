Abstract

In this article, Ross examines the Tax Court of Canada’s 2023 Husky Energy Inc. decision addressing the beneficial ownership provision in Canada’s treaty with Luxembourg. Ross criticizes the court’s analysis of the domestic withholding tax because under the results, no treaty benefits would be available unless the direct recipient of the dividend was the beneficial owner.
