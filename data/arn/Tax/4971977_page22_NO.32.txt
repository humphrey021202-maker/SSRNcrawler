Abstract

Canadian income tax rules applicable to foreign owned Canadian corporations have become increasingly complex, in part owing to the implementation of recommendations of the OECD/G20 BEPS project to address the issue of base erosion and profit shifting. This paper considers these anti-avoidance rules, including the hybrid mismatch arrangement rules, excessive interest and financing expense limitation rules and various surplus stripping rules.
