Abstract

This paper constructs and analyzes a rudimentary game-theoretic model to better understand the policy choice between a global minimum tax regime that operates country-by-country and one that operates based on MNEs’ global average tax rates. The paper’s findings run counter to the consensus view. That view favors a country-by-country regime for two kinds of reasons: it collects more tax liability from MNEs; and it is more effective in preventing harmful tax competition among taxing jurisdictions. The model in this paper suggests that a global average regime is superior to a country-by-country regime on both scores.
