Abstract

I investigate the link between dividend taxes and stock prices in a global setting. Based on findings from an open-economy after-tax capital asset pricing model, I predict that when the U.S. cut its dividend tax rate in 2003, stock prices will increase for high-dividend yield foreign firms that are eligible for a U.S. income tax treaty. I examine returns for firms headquartered in treaty countries and find results consistent with this prediction. In further tests, I find that the same relation does not hold for firms in non-treaty countries. My paper is the first to provide direct evidence about whether and how dividend taxes affect equity prices across an integrated global economy.

Keywords: Shareholder dividend taxes, Tax capitalization, Stock prices, Expected stock returns

JEL Classification: H24, G12
