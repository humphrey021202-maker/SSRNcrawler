Abstract

Some pundits and politicians have seen tax evasion as a serious fiscal problem for the United States government and have called for increasing the number of tax collectors by as much as 87,000. The stated goal is to squeeze more money out of the rich, who presumably are not paying their "fair share." The weakness in this argument is that there are not that many super rich people who are not already paying what they legally owe, with the result that most of the proposed 87,000 new tax collectors will likely be sent to squeeze more money out of the middle class, since that is where most of the money is. This paper proposes an alternative solution to the tax evasion "problem" that involves removing the reasons people have used to evade taxes.

Keywords: tax evasion, tax collections JEL Codes: H20
