Abstract

This essay critically examines the debt-equity distinction in corporate tax systems, arguing that it undermines sound tax policy by failing to meet principles of efficiency, fairness, and simplicity. Historically justified for administrative convenience and alignment with traditional financial metrics, the distinction now appears outdated given the complexities of modern financial instruments and global capital markets. The essay explores the theoretical foundations, practical repercussions, and global inconsistencies of the debt-equity divide. It highlights how the distinction creates a 'debt-bias' that distorts financial structures, encourages over-leverage, and introduces systemic risks. Additionally, it raises concerns about fairness, as the bias disproportionately affects smaller, innovative firms and amplifies disparities between large corporations and smaller enterprises. The essay concludes that reliance on the debt-equity distinction is not appropriate for corporate tax systems and calls for a re-evaluation of tax policies to better align with contemporary financial realities.

Keywords: Tax, Debt bias, Debt-equity distinction, Debt-equity divide
