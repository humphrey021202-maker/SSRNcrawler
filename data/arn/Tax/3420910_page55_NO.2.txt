Abstract

Appendix A provides a more exhaustive discussion of the bunching we see in the data. It also shows how our bunching estimates vary under alternative parameter choices and polynomial degrees. Appendix B provides descriptive statistics of our Main Sample. Finally, Appendix C discusses the kinks we study that do not generate meaningful bunching patterns.
