Abstract

Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) have become an increasingly important instrument in the energy market, particularly as companies seek to manage their electricity costs and sustainability commitments.

In this article, the authors examine the complex legal and tax framework surrounding virtual PPAs, with a specific focus on recent developments in the Italian context.
