Abstract

The COVID-19 outbreak has caused both a health and an economic crisis worldwide. The European Commission has activated the general escape clause of the Stability and Growth Pact in order to enable national governments to better support the national economies as the budgetary rules have been significantly relaxed. Moreover, the Commission has made liquidity measures available to support European small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as they are considered to have been badly hit by the public health measures and not been able to absorb their losses. Specifically, according to the Commission Recommendation 2021/801, the Member States may allow the loss carry back for fiscal years 2020 and 2021 for their SMEs in order to increase their liquidity and immediately help struggling companies. In this study, we initially present the current status of the implementation to the EU Recommendation in European and Non-European States and furthermore analyze the profile and profitability of the Greek SMEs for the fiscal year 2020, in order to assess the impact of a potential application of this recommendation in regard both to the liquidity of SMEs and to government revenues.

Keywords: Tax loss carrybacks, SMEs, COVID-19

JEL Classification: M41, K34
