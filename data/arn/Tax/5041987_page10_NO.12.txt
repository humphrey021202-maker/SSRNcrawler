Abstract

My paper employs big data analytics to extract and examine sentiments from tax community discussions on the r/IRS subreddit. Utilizing 927 popular posts, the study leverages PRAW and OpenAI’s GPT-4 to perform an aspect-based sentiment analysis, identifying key issues related to IRS transcripts. Findings indicate significant confusion and negativity concerning transcript types, acquisition difficulties, and utility misunderstandings among tax professionals. I discuss the functional roles of various IRS transcripts like Tax Return, Account, Wage and Income, and Record of Account Transcripts, highlighting their specific utilities in tax practices, from auditing to resolving disputes. I also elaborate on the challenges faced by professionals due to procedural complexities, technical issues with the IRS’s e-Services, and the steep learning curve for interpreting these documents. Moreover, I make suggestions for improvements in IRS digital tools and advocate for professional development to enhance transcript utilization effectively. This research contributes to understanding the practical barriers and educational gaps that tax professionals face, proposing a pathway toward more efficient and informed tax practices.
