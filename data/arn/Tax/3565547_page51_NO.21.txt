Abstract

The removal of an intertemporal tax discontinuity in Germany provides us with a natural experiment to study the causal effect of taxes on individual stock-trading
behavior and the disposition effect. Using individual investor transactions data combined with nonparametric regressions and bunching methods, we find that the
presence of the tax discontinuity induces investors to adjust their holding periods, which reduces their effective tax rate by 11.3%. We also find that tax effects
dominate the disposition effect in the days around the discontinuity and can inhibit it (by about 20%) during the six months preceding the discontinuity. We discuss
the consequences of our results for the firms whose stocks are traded and policy implications.

Keywords: JEL Classification: H20, G11, D14, C41 Private investors, Trading Behavior, Capital-gains, Taxation, Disposition Effect
