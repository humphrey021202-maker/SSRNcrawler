Abstract

Drawing on fieldwork investigations of shoe manufacturers in Southeast China, this article provides empirical evidence for understanding their taxpaying practices. We find that since the legitimacy of tax law is largely absent amongst business taxpayers, instrumental considerations dominate taxpayers’ decisions between paying and not paying taxes. We then incorporate “structural opportunities to evade” and “perceived costs to evade” to develop a two-by-two matrix to understand the following types of behavior: aggressive evasion, obliged compliance, strategic compliance, and reciprocal compliance. We argue that the matrix explains why VAT (value added tax) fraud is widespread in China, but voluntary compliance is rare. It also helps understand compliance more generally in developing economies.

Keywords: tax compliance, structural opportunities, perceived costs, tax system in China
