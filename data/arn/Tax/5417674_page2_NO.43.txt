Abstract

Traditional tax incentives operate as incomplete insurance mechanisms, absorbing downside financial risks for socially beneficial activities while failing to account for negative externalities that these same activities may generate. This asymmetric risk allocation creates moral hazard problems where governments subsidize private innovation that can produce both public benefits and social harms, leaving society exposed to catastrophic risks as an involuntary insurer of last resort.

This Article argues that tax incentives should be reconceptualized as comprehensive hedging instruments rather than mere insurance mechanisms. True hedging requires addressing both positive spillovers and negative externalities generated while undertaking the incentivized activities. This approach is particularly relevant for AI governance, where the temporal disconnect between innovation investments and their consequences creates regulatory challenges that traditional approaches cannot address. Using AI development as a paradigmatic case study, the paper demonstrates how current innovation policy exemplifies “incomplete hedging”—encouraging technological advancement through tax benefits while neglecting associated safety risks and systemic harms. Recent AI policy, exemplified by the Trump administration’s hands-off approach prioritizing competitive advantage over oversight, demonstrates the urgent need for risk allocation mechanisms that align private incentives with public safety.

As a solution, the Article proposes designing “contingent tax incentives” that provide conditional benefits that directly correlate to verifiable safety investments and ex post clawback provisions if deployment results in public harm. This framework integrates externality pricing mechanisms, a systematic quantification of both beneficial spillovers and harmful consequences. It also combines risk-sharing structures including recapture provisions, risk-pooling, and corrective taxes. These mechanisms create fiscal deterrence and accountability where conventional tort law and insurance markets prove insufficient. By embedding contingent accountability frameworks within fiscal architecture, tax law can serve as a dynamic tool for managing catastrophic risk in emerging technologies while maintaining private-market players flexibility and autonomy in investment decisions. 

Carefully designed tax systems can serve as effective government hedging that foster aligned financial incentives, ensuring private actors have stakeholders’ accountability in outcomes (both positive and negative) rather than acting solely as passive beneficiaries of public subsidies. In doing so, the government effectively shares the cost of policy implementation with market participants who possess specialized expertise, while promoting full risk-bearing positions that internalize a portion of the uncertainty and cost associated with valuable public goods such as AI safety. Through an optimal carrot-and-stick approach, tax policy not only mobilizes private resources but also enhances risk management and social welfare.
