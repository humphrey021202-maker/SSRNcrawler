Abstract

Policymakers claim that combating tax avoidance can help reduce industry concentration by levelling the playing field between industry leaders, which are typically better equipped to shift profits across jurisdictions, and their competitors. We test the validity of this claim by employing administrative data on industry concentration and exploiting the staggered introduction of anti-tax avoidance regulations across 17 European countries. While we do find that these regulations are effective in significantly reducing tax avoidance, we do not find any evidence that they have an impact—statistically or economically—on industry concentration. Our inferences are robust to multiple research designs and settings. Additional tests give us confidence that our non-results stem from a genuine lack of effect rather than a lack of statistical power. Overall, our findings cast doubt on the idea that broad-based anti-tax avoidance regulations can materially influence industry concentration.

Keywords: Tax avoidance, industry concentration, competition, anti-tax avoidance regulation
