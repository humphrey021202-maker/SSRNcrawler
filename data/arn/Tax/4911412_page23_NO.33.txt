Abstract

This study investigates the factors influencing auditor remuneration in a multisectoral context at B3, addressing a gap in the literature regarding the relationship between tax litigation and auditor fees in Brazil. Utilizing a descriptive methodology based on panel data analysis, data were collected from the Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM) website and the Comdinheiro database, covering 233 companies across various sectors from 2017 to 2022, resulting in 1,398 observations. Employing a fixed-effect econometric model, the study highlights tax litigation (LT) as a key variable. The results reveal that both tax litigation (LT) and its interaction with corporate governance (LT*CG) significantly impact auditor remuneration, confirming the hypotheses. Specifically, an increase in tax litigation is positively associated with higher auditor fees, suggesting that auditors charge more when dealing with companies involved in tax disputes. This study provides a critical empirical foundation for guiding strategic decisions by companies, particularly in selecting audit firms that enhance investor confidence. The findings underscore the importance of understanding the interplay between tax litigation, auditor fees, and corporate governance. It is recommended that future research further explore these variables to deepen insights into the dynamics between auditor remuneration, audit quality, financial performance, and investor confidence over time. The study's contributions are vital for regulators, managers, and investors seeking to navigate the complexities of the Brazilian market and improve corporate governance practices.

Keywords: Tax Litigation, Auditor Remuneration, Corporate Governance, Panel Data Analysis, Brazilian Capital Market
