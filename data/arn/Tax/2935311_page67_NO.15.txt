Abstract

This paper runs a carbon tax simulation using Indonesia Household expenditure. Three scenarios with different tax rate are conducted together with two schemes: revenue cycling and no revenue cycling. The result shows a robust finding that the impact of carbon tax in Indonesia is progressive in all three simulations. The introduction of a revenue cycling scheme would even increase the rate of progressivity. This is in line with Yusuf and Resosudarmo (2007); higher carbon tax rates lowering income inequality. Comparing the three simulations conducted in this study, the carbon tax at IDR 280.000/tC02 gives the most significant effect on Gini Coefficient as it was expected. The Gini Coefficient decreases from ex ante condition 47.43 to 45.83 ex post condition; leave 1.60 decreasing of Gini Coefficient. This study supports a dissenting opinion towards the studies of distributional impact of carbon tax in developed countries in which a notorious regressive impact is generally found. Whether this finding can be generalized to other developing countries is still an open question due to the different expenditure pattern. This study only covers the equity issue of policy evaluation criteria, further investigation towards other criteria is undoubtedly important as a corner stone for the extension of this study.

Keywords: Inequality, Carbon Tax, Indonesia
