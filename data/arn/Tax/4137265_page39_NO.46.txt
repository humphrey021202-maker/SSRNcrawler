Abstract

This study examines whether multinational corporations employ managers jointly at the headquarters and foreign subsidiaries (vertical manager interlocks) to facilitate tax planning by mitigating an internal principal-agent conflict. We utilize a cross-sectional dataset for European firms to demonstrate that vertical manager interlocks are more prevalent in multinational corporations with greater potential for tax-motivated profit shifting and implemented mainly in high-tax subsidiaries. A one standard deviation increase in the statutory tax rate volatility within a multinational corporation is associated with 1.2 percent more vertical manager interlocks, representing over 25 percent of the sample average. We reveal that applying vertical manager interlock structures results in a lower effective tax rate. Vertical manager interlocks are especially pertinent for profit shifting through transfer pricing rather than debt shifting. A one standard deviation increase in the usage of this structure is associated with a 1.2 percentage point reduction in the multinational corporation’s ETR, corresponding to almost 5 percent of the average ETR.

Keywords: management structure, profit shifting, principal-agent-theory

JEL Classification: H25, H26, M12
