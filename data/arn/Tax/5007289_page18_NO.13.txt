Abstract

In this article, Narotzki explores the resurgence of high tariffs in U.S. trade policy, beginning with the Trump administration and continuing into the Biden administration, that were initially intended to protect domestic industries and reduce trade deficits, but have instead led to increased consumer prices, strained diplomatic relationships, and harmed global trade dynamics.

Keywords: Federal Tax, Tax Policy, Tariffs
