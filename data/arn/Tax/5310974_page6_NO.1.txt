Abstract

In Chile, changes to VAT law have become a trend in recent years. Indirect taxes are perceived as an efficient way to increase tax revenue without having to engage in lengthy policy discussions, as is the case with direct taxes. As a result, several disruptive changes have taken place or are being proposed without a proper policy analysis from an indirect tax perspective. The author in this article analyses said changes, including VAT on services, the impact on professional services, changes to VAT refunds associated with the acquisition or construction of fixed assets, and the ever more important role of platforms.
