Abstract

Combining a survey of more than 20,000 German taxpayers with administrative data on tax office performance and employee satisfaction, we examine the effect of better tax administration services on taxpayer behavior. We find that higher service interaction quality (SIQ) is positively associated with tax compliance, but with important heterogeneity. Higher SIQ primarily increases compliance among less educated taxpayers, reflecting improved interpersonal treatment. Higher SIQ also reduces appeals for both high- and less-educated taxpayers, but through different mechanisms: improved interpersonal treatment is more relevant for less-educated taxpayers, while better information services matter more to high-educated taxpayers. Moreover, better SIQ reduces compliance costs, especially for highly educated taxpayers, with better information services as a mediating factor. Finally, organizational climate appears crucial for the efficient implementation of improved SIQ. Our results highlight the importance of tailoring service improvements and suggest that both interpersonal treatment and information quality are associated with improved compliance behavior.
