Abstract

Despite an ongoing increase in global revenues for network products, current discussions on tax reforms mostly neglect the specific demand pattern of these products. In contrast to traditional products, the customer value of network products increases in the number of co-users implying that international sales matter for domestic ones. This paper compares firm-level tax-induced distortions of sales quantities for network products and traditional products in a cross-border setting. For standard tax allocation mechanisms, we identify settings for which the specificities of network products trigger counterintuitive consequences.
For traditional transfer pricing methods sales of traditional products are only aﬀected by corporate taxation in the importing country, while optimal sales quantities of network products typically vary with tax-rate diﬀerentials. Under a residual profit split method, we find symmetric distortions across countries for an upfront production remuneration, but diﬀerent real eﬀects for a sales remuneration. Overall, optimal sales quantities of traditional and network products are aﬀected diﬀerently by both methods, but changes appear more predictable under the residual profit split method.

Keywords: network products, profit shifting, profit split, tax-induced distortions of sales, transfer pricing
