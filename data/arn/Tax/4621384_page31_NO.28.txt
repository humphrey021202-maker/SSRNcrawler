Abstract

Using Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) deals, we study U.S. tax pitfalls common to cross-border deals that incur otherwise avoidable U.S. tax costs. While many SPAC deals are structured to avoid such tax consequences, a nontrivial portion of SPAC deals (36.5 percent) are structured in a tax-disadvantaged manner. Among deals involving U.S. SPACs, we find that tax-disadvantaged cross-border deals exhibit lower deal announcement returns, attract less private investment (PIPE), and have worse post-merger accounting performance relative to same-border deals. These negative outcomes are concentrated in deals most likely to trigger U.S. anti-inversion rules. We conduct robustness tests to address concerns that nontax heterogeneity of foreign-incorporated targets or deSPAC entities explains our results. The collective findings support the conclusion that tax-disadvantaged deals serve as early indicators of potential sponsor moral hazard and investor misalignment. This evidence is particularly relevant to SPAC investors amid the recent resurgence of SPAC IPOs and deals.

Keywords: special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), agency costs, U.S. tax costs, anti-inversion rules
