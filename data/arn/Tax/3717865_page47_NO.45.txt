Abstract

This study examines the impact of enterprise risk management (ERM) programs on corporate tax planning. ERM is a holistic approach to managing an enterprise’s entire portfolio of risks (COSO 2004, 2017). We hand-collect data on ERM adoption for a sample of S&P 500 firms from 1993 to 2016. We empirically document that firms with ERM programs have lower cash effective tax rates (ETRs) than firms without ERM. Additionally, we find that the relation between ERM and tax avoidance is stronger among firms with more business segments. Finally, our results suggest ERM adoption offsets increases in opacity and tax uncertainty typically associated with tax avoidance strategies. Overall, we provide evidence that ERM allows firms to exploit tax avoidance opportunities through enhanced coordination and communication.

Keywords: Enterprise Risk Management (ERM), Tax Avoidance, Opacity, Tax Uncertainty
