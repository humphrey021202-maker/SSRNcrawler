Abstract

The global minimum tax framework has enabled jurisdictions to apply the Qualified Domestic Top-up Tax (QDMTT). Its application may lead to potential trade barriers, as it excludes domestic entities that are not members of an MNE. This condition potentially creates violations against the most-favoured nation and national treatment principles.
