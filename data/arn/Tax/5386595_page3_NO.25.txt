Abstract

The rapid expansion of cryptocurrency markets has fundamentally challenged the architecture of traditional tax systems. As digital asset transactions increasingly bypass institutional oversight, national and international tax frameworks remain fragmented, reactive, and insufficient. This paper critically examines the structural, technological, and policy-driven barriers that inhibit global tax systems from effectively regulating cryptocurrency conversions, particularly the transformation of digital assets into fiat currencies. Drawing upon a comparative analysis of tax regimes across the United States, European Union, United Arab Emirates, and Singapore, this study identifies systemic inconsistencies in the classification of crypto assets, the recognition of taxable events, and the enforcement of cross-border reporting standards. The research highlights the growing prevalence of decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, peer-to-peer exchanges, and privacy-enhancing technologies, which further complicate tax compliance and erode the ability of authorities to trace digital wealth. Using an interdisciplinary framework grounded in regulatory arbitrage theory and institutional economics, the paper explores the interplay between policy inertia, technological complexity, and jurisdictional competition. It critically assesses the limitations of emerging efforts such as the OECD's Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) and FATF's Travel Rule, arguing that without coordinated global standards, crypto tax evasion will persist through legal voids and regulatory arbitrage. The study concludes with a set of policy imperatives for achieving equitable, technologically feasible, and internationally harmonized approaches to digital asset taxation-ensuring tax integrity without stifling innovation or violating digital privacy rights.
