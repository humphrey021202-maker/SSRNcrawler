Abstract

In this article he examines the claim, which has been publicized in recent months, that the Treasury Department could unilaterally index the capital gains tax for inflation by a new regulation interpreting code section 1012. He concludes, in light of more than seven decades of administrative, judicial and legislative history, that such unilateral action would be invalid.

Keywords: Tax, Treasury, Index, Inflation, Capital Gains
