Abstract

This study examines how tax knowledge diffuses via strategic alliances, affecting firms’ tax planning equilibria. We empirically document economically meaningful decreases in the effective tax rates of high-tax firms in strategic alliances with low-tax firms relative to those allied with other high-tax firms. Our findings suggest that tax knowledge diffusion occurs through private exchange, which materializes over time via sustained collaboration among alliance partners. Thus, we not only reveal an undocumented yet meaningful economic effect of business cooperation, our study also informs practitioners and policymakers by showing how fostering collaboration through strategic alliances can influence firms’ tax planning.

Keywords: Knowledge Diffusion, Strategic Alliance, tax planning
