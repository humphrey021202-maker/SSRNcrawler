Abstract

This study examines the evolution of unrecognized tax benefit (UTB) reporting under FIN 48, a complex framework for accounting for contingent tax liabilities. At adoption, favorable financial accounting treatment created an incentive to record initially conservative UTB reserves. Consistent with this temporary incentive, we document a significant on-average decline in UTBs post-adoption, suggesting subsequent refinement in UTB reporting. Our findings suggest that the UTB decline reflects changes in financial reporting rather than changes in tax avoidance, firm fundamentals, or earnings management. We identify three sources through which managers acquire information to refine UTB estimates post-adoption: tax authorities, peer firm financial disclosures, and shared financial statement auditors. Finally, we present novel evidence of improved comparability of UTB reserves over time. This study underscores the importance of understanding how compliance with new accounting standards evolves over time. Our results suggest that declining UTBs do not necessarily signal reductions in tax avoidance.

Keywords: corporate taxation, tax uncertainty, uncertain tax benefits, accounting method change, FIN 48
