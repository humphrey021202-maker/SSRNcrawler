Abstract

Almost all countries levy a general turnover tax, i.e. a tax on essentially all goods and services supplied by manufacturers, traders and service providers. Those turnover taxes are mostly levied under a VAT type of tax system and, in a decreasing number of cases, as a multi or single-stage (retail) sales tax. This article presents an overview of those general turnover taxes and the tax rates applicable on 1 January 2022.
