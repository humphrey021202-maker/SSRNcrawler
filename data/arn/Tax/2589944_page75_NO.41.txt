Abstract

The paper analyzes empirically the impact of switching to Taiwan's new Integrated Tax System in 1998 on the valuation of dividends. The Elton & Gruber [Rev. Econ. Stat. 1970] model is used to analyze the ratio of the ex-day stock price drop-off to the cash dividend per share. After adjusting for the tax changes and changes in the tick limits, significant increases were found for the drop-off ratios for taxable cash dividends and taxable stock dividends, but no changes were found for tax-exempt dividends.

Keywords: Ex-dividend stock price drop-off, Elton & Gruber 1970 model, tax reform, tick size
