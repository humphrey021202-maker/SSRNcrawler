Abstract

We study how U.S. state personal and corporate income taxes have affected pre-tax income inequality (income shares and top incomes) during the last century. The long panel nature of our data, from 1917 to 2018, allows us to study the effect of tax adoptions, tax cancellations, and tax changes, and to assess both immediate and long-term relationships. With event study, synthetic control, and heterogeneity-robust two-way fixed effects designs, we generally find no statistically significant or economically significant relationship between tax measures and inequality.

Keywords: D63, H24, H25, H71, N32, income inequality, taxation, state tax policy
