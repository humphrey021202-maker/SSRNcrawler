Abstract

Business income is systematically underreported and accounts for a sizeable share of the US tax gap. In this paper, I examine the importance of tax evasion in the entrepreneurial sector for the effects of tax reforms. In particular, I analyze the long-run effects of switching from a progressive income tax to a proportional one. The quantitative framework used is a model with heterogeneous
agents and incomplete markets that features an entrepreneurial choice and a tax evasion decision. Explicitly considering tax evasion in this reform implies: i) significantly lower increases in capital accumulation and output, and ii) a less negative impact on wealth concentration.

Keywords: tax evasion, entrepreneurs, wealth inequality, progressive income taxation
