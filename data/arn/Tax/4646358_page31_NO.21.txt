Abstract

Using a large sample of Chinese A-share listed firms over the period from 2008 to 2020, this paper examines the effect of tax avoidance on firm value. It finds a significantly positive relation between tax avoidance and firm value, and the effect is conditional on corporate governance quality. The results are robust to the use of alternative tax avoidance measures and alternative estimation techniques. Heterogeneity analysis reveals that the conditionality on corporate governance quality is mostly driven by non-state-owned enterprises and younger firms. Moreover, the effect of tax avoidance on firm value by corporate governance is stronger for big companies than for small companies.

Keywords: Tax avoidance, Corporate governance, Firm value

JEL Classification: G32, G34, H26
