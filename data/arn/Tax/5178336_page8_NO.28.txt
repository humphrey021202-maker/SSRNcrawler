Abstract

In this article, the authors argue that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act’s short-term economic stimulus has been overshadowed by mounting fiscal challenges and unfulfilled promises. They highlight concerns about the sustainability of extending the expiring provisions without addressing revenue shortfalls and call for a targeted restructuring of the TCJA provisions to prioritize long-term fiscal stability over short-erm political gain.

Keywords: TCJA, Fiscal Policy, Federal Tax Policy, Tax Reform
