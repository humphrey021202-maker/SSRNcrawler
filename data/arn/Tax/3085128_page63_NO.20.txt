Abstract

This article discusses two inter-twined issues that arose in the Indian case of Vodafone India Services Pvt Ltd v Union of India, namely (a) whether the issue of shares by a subsidiary to its non-resident parent company is a taxable transaction; and (b) whether the issue of equity shares by a subsidiary to its holding company at a value lower than the fair market value falls under the transfer pricing provisions.

Keywords: Issue of Shares, Subsidiary Company, Foreign Holding Company, Taxable Transaction, Transfer Pricing Provisions
