Abstract

Property tax limitations reduce the pro-cyclicality of property taxes, creating a distinct form of covariance risk. Controlling for the level of taxation, we find that a one standard deviation increase in covariance risk raises the probability of mortgage distress by 30\%, with stronger effects for financially vulnerable and racial minority households. We identify these effects using parcel-level data, a state border discontinuity design, and a novel property tax simulator that incorporates assessment, rate, and levy limitations, along with other key tax system characteristics. These findings underscore how tax policy affects risk and supports policies, such as targeted tax deferral programs, that could mitigate these risks.

Keywords: Property Taxation, Tax Limitations, Risk, Distress, Mortgage Default, Foreclosure
