Abstract

This chapter examines the tax implications of stateless individual taxpayers, focusing on highly mobile persons who either claim no fiscal residence under any national system or benefit from preferential regimes that exempt foreign income. It critiques the limitations of existing domestic rules and international tax treaties in addressing the growing gap between legal residency and economic reality
