Abstract

For over a century, the nation’s transfer tax regime, comprised of the gift, estate, and generation-skipping transfer taxes, has played a pivotal role in curbing inherited wealth while simultaneously raising much-needed revenue. But for a variety of reasons, a sizable number of taxpayers are derelict in fulfilling their transfer tax obligations. This analysis explores the reasons for this phenomenon and the reforms that Congress should consider instituting to curb this behavior.

Keywords: Transfer Tax, Tap Gap

JEL Classification: K34
