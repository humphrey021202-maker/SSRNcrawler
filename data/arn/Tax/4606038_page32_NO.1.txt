Abstract

We investigate whether and how resource constraints faced by tax authorities affect corporate tax avoidance. Using Chinese IPO events as an exogenous shock that results in a sudden increase in workload in the local tax bureau and a strain on administrative resources, we reveal an increase in tax avoidance among firms in the same district as the IPO firm. The main findings are robust to a serial of sensitivity tests. The cross-sectional analyses, mechanism tests and semi-structured interviews provide consistent results. Collectively, our findings suggest that tax authorities compromise the quality of oversight when facing unexpected resource constraints.

Keywords: IPO spillover effect, Corporate tax avoidance, Tax administration, Resource constraints
