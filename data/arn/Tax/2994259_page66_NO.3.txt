Abstract

Academic researchers and the public have long shared an interest in whether and how corporate political activity (CPA) relates to taxes and tax policy. This paper reviews the literature on tax-related CPA. We frame our discussion around three main questions: (1) which firms are likely to engage in tax-related CPA; (2) what do firms expect to gain from participating in politics; and (3) how do firms achieve their political goals? We highlight contributions made by prior studies and identify themes to guide future research. We also provide detailed information on available data and resources for interested researchers.

Keywords: Taxation, Corporate Political Activity

JEL Classification: H25, H32
