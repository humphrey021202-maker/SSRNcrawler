Abstract

This paper critically examines the suitability of using accounting profit as a tax base or as the starting point for a tax base in corporate profit taxation, within the context of global economic interconnectivity and significant international tax reforms, such as the OECD's Pillar Two framework. The discussion begins by highlighting the complexity and dynamic nature of accounting profit and its role in corporate profit taxation. It then explores the theoretical and practical implications of adopting accounting profit as a direct tax base, weighing the benefits of simplicity and transparency against issues of equity and economic efficiency. The paper also considers the potential of using accounting profit as a starting point for determining the corporate tax base, discussing the necessary adjustments and their implications. Additionally, it briefly examines other potential tax bases, such as taxable income determined by autonomous tax laws and economic profit, comparing their practicality and theoretical soundness. The paper concludes by advocating for a nuanced, context-sensitive approach to the role of accounting profit in tax policy, emphasising the importance of balancing simplicity, equity, and economic efficiency. This analysis underscores the need for a thoughtful decision-making process in tax policy, considering the diverse socio-economic and legal contexts of different jurisdictions.
