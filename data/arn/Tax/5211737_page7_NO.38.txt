Abstract

The growing popularity of home-sharing platforms such as Airbnb, partly fueled by hosts' ability to evade local taxes and regulations, has been shown to elevate housing costs by reallocating longterm housing units to the short-term rental market. This study assesses whether enhanced tax enforcement can mitigate this trend. We analyze staggered tax collection agreements between Airbnb and Florida counties, wherein Airbnb collects taxes from the hosts directly. Using a difference-indifferences methodology, we find these agreements significantly slow the growth of housing costs, highlighting the importance of tax policy in addressing the sharing economy's influence on housing affordability.
