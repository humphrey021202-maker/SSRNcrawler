Abstract

In this article, Michael Smart presents evidence on the evolution of top tax rates and tax progressivity since 1982. While top tax rates have recently increased substantially, the impact of these changes on redistribution through the tax system has been rather small to date. Smart suggests some possible explanations for this finding.

Keywords: tax rates, tax revenues, redistribution, equality
