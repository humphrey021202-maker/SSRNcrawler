Abstract

This paper studies the inequality in property taxation in the U.S. single-family home market
based on a property’s assessed value. Comparing the assessment ratio of properties owned by
investors with those of owner-occupiers, we find a 3.0%–4.7% assessment discount nationwide
for properties owned by large investors (i.e., those owning more than 100 properties) relative
to owner-occupied homes in the same areas. This difference translates into an estimated total
annual property tax savings of $66–$104 million for large investors across the country. Further
evidence based on micro-level appeals data in Cook County, Illinois, and Florida suggests
that the institutional assessment discount results from a higher likelihood of appeal and more
favorable outcomes upon a successful appeal for large investors. States with a fairer property
taxation administration, a higher market share by large investors, and a higher property tax
burden show a greater assessment discount for large investors.

Keywords: Property Taxation, Real Estate, Institutional Investor, Single-Family Rental
