Abstract

Global tax enforcement policies have received increased attention since the Financial Crisis, with much stated focus on curbing perceived harmful tax practices of multinational corporations. Yet there is a dearth of evidence on possible differential effects of home country tax enforcement on multinationals. We take a step toward filling this void in the tax policy discussion by examining whether there is a differential relation between changes in home-country enforcement and the tax avoidance of domestic versus multinational corporations. Using OECD data on 50 countries from 2005 to 2019, we find increases in home-country enforcement are associated with lower levels of tax avoidance for domestic firms than for multinational corporations. Using a subset of firms from the Bureau van Dijk database, we find that multinationals avoid more tax in foreign countries when home-country enforcement increases. Results are stronger for multinationals with a higher proportion of subsidiaries in low-tax countries and when enforcement spending is low. These findings have implications for policymakers and highlight the importance of coordinated enforcement efforts across jurisdictions — such as the recently proposed global minimum tax — to successfully curb multinationals’ worldwide tax avoidance.

Keywords: tax enforcement, tax avoidance, international tax, income shifting
