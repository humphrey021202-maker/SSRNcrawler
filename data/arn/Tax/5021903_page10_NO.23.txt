Abstract

This article examines incentives for postponing retirement in Spain. Employees who delay retirement after meeting eligibility requirements may choose between a lump-sum payment or a lifelong pension increase. The analysis focuses on factors influencing this choice, including initial pension amount, contribution period, expected pension growth, subjective discount rate, and gender (affecting life expectancy). The paper calculates the minimum post-retirement survival period required to justify selecting the monthly incentive, along with sensitivities to key determinants.

Keywords: pensions, postponing retirement, incentives, life expectancy, discount rate JEL Classification: J22
