Abstract

This study explores the dynamics between tax consultancy services provided by independent auditors and the incidence of tax litigation in corporations. It investigates whether companies that engage independent auditors for tax advice are more likely to face tax disputes. Employing a robust methodological framework, this research analyzes a balanced panel dataset comprising 416 observations from companies listed on B3 from 2017 to 2020. Multiple linear regression models are utilized to evaluate the impact of various financial activities, including audit expenditures, tax service expenses, and their proportions relative to total assets, on the intensity of tax litigation. The findings indicate a significant correlation between increased expenditures on audit and tax services and a higher incidence of tax disputes. Specifically, companies with substantial audit-related expenditures and significant investments in tax services relative to their total assets are prone to more frequent litigation. This correlation suggests that while tax consultancy offers essential compliance and strategic advantages, it also heightens the risk of legal challenges. These insights underscore the importance of the scale of expenditures relative to the firm's assets. This study enriches the academic literature and serves as a practical guide for corporate decision-makers in understanding how tax consultancy influences litigation risks.
