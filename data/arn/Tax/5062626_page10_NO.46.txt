Abstract

This paper examines the effect of tax uncertainty on the purchase of auditor-provided tax services (APTS). Due to the frequency of both proposed and enacted tax reforms firms face significant tax uncertainty. Using a cross-European sample over the years 2009 to 2021, we predict and find a significant positive association between country-level tax uncertainty and APTS. This link is more pronounced for large firms, profitable firms, firms with R&D/Intangibles, multinational firms, and firms with a Big 4 auditor. We also confirm our results using a firm-level measure of tax uncertainty. Regulators continue to question the potential independence concerns related to non-audit services such as APTS and have enacted restrictions on these services. We also find regulatory restrictions on the provision of APTS curb the demand for APTS when firms face tax uncertainty. Finally, we find that firms experience an increase in tax uncertainty following these decreases in APTS. Overall, these findings suggest that firms rely on the auditor's tax expertise when facing tax uncertainty. However, regulations limiting APTS attenuate this association. These results add to the growing literature on the consequences of tax uncertainty and the determinants, as well as, the costs and benefits of imposing restrictions on APTS.
