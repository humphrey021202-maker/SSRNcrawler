Abstract

The rapid expansion of electronic commerce (e-commerce) poses significant challenges to traditional tax systems worldwide. This research paper thoroughly explores the complex terrain of e-commerce taxation in the digital age, highlighting the imperative for regulatory interventions. It delves into intricate issues such as the identification of taxpayers, determination of transaction locations, and classification of income within the digital domain. The study critically examines the concept of Permanent Establishment (PE), specifically focusing on digital triggers like servers and websites. In the context of Tanzania, the paper scrutinizes corporate income tax and addresses concerns related to online businesses evading taxation by sidestepping physical presence requirements. Throughout the investigation, emphasis is placed on the difficulties associated with taxing e-commerce in Tanzania, prompting an examination of global initiatives seeking a unified approach. Employing a doctrinal research methodology and drawing insights from primary and secondary sources, this paper contributes to the comprehension of e-commerce taxation by elucidating its complexities and underscoring the essential need for effective regulation.

Keywords: E-commerce taxation, Digital age challenges, Permanent establishment, Taxpayer identification, international tax regulation
