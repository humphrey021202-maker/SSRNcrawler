Abstract

Governments often try to promote an equitable distribution of the tax burden by imposing progressive income tax rates, meaning that higher-earning taxpayers pay a higher tax rate than lower-earning taxpayers. However, perceptions of equity are highly subjective, and high-income individuals may perceive these tax policies as inequitable because they pay a higher tax rate than lower-income individuals, leading them to seek higher income to offset the perceived inequity. We examine the role of income tax progression on executive compensation and find that these two constructs are positively related. We estimate that an interquartile (minimum to maximum) shift in income tax progression is associated with 1.46% (7.85%) higher executive compensation that is concentrated in cash-based sources, suggesting a shift in compensation composition toward more immediate cash-flow-based income. We conclude that income tax progression alters executives’ perceived equity of their income tax liability, motivating them to demand higher compensation.

Keywords: Progressive Income Taxation, Executive Compensation, Cash Compensation, Non-Cash Compensation, Income Equality
