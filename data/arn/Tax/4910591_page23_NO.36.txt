Abstract

Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 207, the first tax-focused sustainability reporting standard, requires GRI-reporting firms to provide detailed qualitative and quantitative tax disclosures when taxes are material. In this study, we exploit firms’ adoption of GRI 207 to examine how tax disclosures embedded in sustainability reporting evolve and how they are related to corporate tax behavior. We are the first to use a combination of automated and manual textual analysis approaches, including the domain-specific large language model (LLM) TaxBERT, to study disclosure content and the characteristics of tax sustainability disclosures. We find that firms implement new tax strategies and revise their tax compliance management systems following GRI 207 adoption. In a second step, using a difference-in-differences design, we document a persistent 1–2 percentage point increase in GAAP effective tax rates (GAAP ETRs) among adopting firms. Disclosures on changes in tax strategies and risk mitigation efforts are particularly associated with higher GAAP ETRs. The results hold through multiple robustness tests addressing endogeneity, including a stacked cohort design. Our findings have policy implications, suggesting that corporate tax avoidance can be discouraged by integrating tax disclosure requirements into sustainability reporting frameworks.
