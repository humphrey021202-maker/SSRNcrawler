Abstract

Old tax regulations are vulnerable to taxpayer challenge, for instance on the theory that Treasury made mistakes in the notice-and-comment process required by the Administrative Procedure Act. But the six-year limitations period of 28 U.S.C. § 2401(a) could time bar these claims. Prior to the Supreme Court's 2024 Corner Post decision, courts clearly should have time-barred such claims if the government raised the six-year limitations period as a defense. After Corner Post, the government can still press the time-bar argument for procedural challenges, based in part on footnote 8 of Corner Post.
