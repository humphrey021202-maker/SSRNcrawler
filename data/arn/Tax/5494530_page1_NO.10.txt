Abstract

This article examines the constitutional and statutory justification for imposing Goods and Services Tax (GST) on the entire value of stakes in online money gaming rather than restricting it to the operator's commission. It argues that such taxation flows logically from the design of GST, which taxes the value of supply as perceived by the recipient and not merely the supplier's margin. The argument is rooted in the treatment of actionable claims within Indian tax law, situates the recent amendments within their legislative history, and addresses claims of arbitrariness under Article 14. The discussion demonstrates that the classification of online gaming as a taxable supply of actionable claims has a clear rational nexus with the object of the law, and that the valuation method prescribed under Rule 31A is neither excessive nor discriminatory. Drawing on comparative models from jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom and Australia, the article shows that India's approach aligns with global practices aimed at preserving tax neutrality and regulatory effectiveness. Finally, the article reflects on the conceptual significance of taxing "chance" in a digital economy, arguing that the levy represents the adaptive capacity of law to capture value in intangible and probabilistic forms.

Keywords: GST, Online Gaming, Actionable Claims, Article 14, Tax Neutrality
