Abstract

This article delves into the contentious issue of taxing churches in Ghana, shedding light on the evolving economic landscape and the increasing reliance on capitalistic tendencies within religious institutions. As churches play a pivotal role in shaping societal values and norms, the question of their fiscal contribution to the nation's development becomes crucial. The article examines the historical context of tax exemptions for religious entities and explores the changing dynamics that warrant a reconsideration of this traditional stance. By analyzing the growing commercial activities and financial investments of churches, the article argues that taxing these institutions aligns with the principles of fiscal equity and social responsibility. Additionally, it discusses potential benefits such as increased government revenue and the promotion of transparency within religious organizations. While acknowledging the sensitivity of the topic, the article aims to stimulate informed discourse on the necessity of reevaluating taxation policies for churches in Ghana within the framework of a progressively capitalistic society.

Keywords: Business, Tax, Church History
