Abstract

This article explains why the effective tax rate for the purposes of the Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) rules may deviate from the nominal corporate income tax rate and fall below 15%, even in high-tax jurisdictions. It further addresses the (non-)application of the substance-based income exclusion in loss situations.
