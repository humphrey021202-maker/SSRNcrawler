Abstract

A competitive equilibrium would drive the world economy to an inefficient outcome of increased greenhouse gas emissions, which shall be corrected by a carbon tax. However, imposing this tax based purely on externalities measurement suffers from an implementation drawback: the political sector is not prawned to implement it because lower deciles are characterized by intense use of pollutants, implying an increased tax burden on fragile segments of society. By maximizing social utility, we calculate optimal deviations from Pigouvian carbon taxes in the transportation sector. We find that these deviations imply a lower pricing for bus public transportation, that is intensively used by low-income individuals; on the other hand, they imply a higher gasoline tax. Implementing the proposed tax schedule reduces taxation inequality by 11 percent.

Keywords: pollution, carbon tax, transport sector

JEL Classification: H23, Q21, Q28
