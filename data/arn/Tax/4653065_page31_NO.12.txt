Abstract

We examine whether taxpayer assistance with tax filing and compliance affects entrepreneurship. Taxpayer Assistance Centers help taxpayers, including entrepreneurs, to correctly file their taxes and navigate the tax system. We find that Taxpayer Assistance Centers positively associate with local entrepreneur entry and with overall Schedule C business income levels. We conclude that taxpayer assistance encourages traditional business entrepreneurship by reducing compliance costs that stem from tax complications and complexity.  

Keywords: Entrepreneurship, taxation, new business formation, taxpayer assistance

JEL Classification: H23, H25, L26, M13
