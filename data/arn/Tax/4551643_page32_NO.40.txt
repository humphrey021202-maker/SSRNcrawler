Abstract

I investigate the influence of interest groups on the textual sentiment of press coverage of tax reforms. Through 2SLS and OLS estimates and a modified control function approach, I identify increases in the differences among represented opinions (subjectivity effect). This subjectivity effect translates into relative increases in both positive and negative textual sentiment within an article. When triangulating whether this evidence indicates balance or ambiguity, I find support for the latter, as interest groups affect articles’ textual sentiment on the negative margin, and information redundancy (i.e., staleness) increases when interest groups appear in press coverage of tax reforms. Overall, I elucidate the press’s role as an information intermediary and document how seeking influence on tax standard-setting is performed when interest group activities are nearly impossible to regulate.

Keywords: Tax Reform, Press Coverage, Interest Groups, Textual Sentiment
