Abstract

Online booking platforms have become very important in the tourism sector. However, the VAT treatment of commissions earned by such booking platforms has still not been conclusively clarified as is shown by the Italian case of Booking.com NL. In this article, the author suggests that to avoid such conflicts between tax authorities and taxable persons it would be necessary that rules are fixed and harmonized across the European Union.
