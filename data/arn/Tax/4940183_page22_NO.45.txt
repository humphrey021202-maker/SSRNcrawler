Abstract

A good tax rule is one that has a clear purpose and is fit to accomplish that purpose. Using this simple baseline for the assessment of source rules contained in the Income Tax Act 2007, this article identifies the main inconsistencies of these rules, and outlines changes that could make these rules more functional and easier to apply, or “better”.
