Abstract

This study empirically examines the relationship between a firm's cost structure and its tax burden. We use a sample of 12,168 firm-year observations of U.S. firms in the S&P 1500 Index from 2007 to 2021. Our results indicate that the operating leverage of a firm's cost structure significantly impacts its tax burden; thus, firms that have a higher proportion of fixed costs to total costs have a higher tax burden. We conduct additional tests to confirm the robustness of our findings.

Keywords: tax avoidance, tax planning, tax burden, cost structure, Operating Leverage
