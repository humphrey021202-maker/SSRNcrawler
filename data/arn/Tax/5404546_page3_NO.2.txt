Abstract

This paper proposes a Wealth Declaration Model as a long-term systemic reform for India’s taxation framework. Unlike traditional income-based taxation, this model requires every citizen and corporate entity to declare their net wealth (assets – liabilities) annually. Tax would be levied only on incremental wealth, while losses would be carried forward. The model eliminates multiple tax categories (STCG, LTCG, VDA, dividend tax, etc.), thereby simplifying compliance, reducing litigation, and saving administrative resources. It directly addresses corruption by surfacing benami and hidden wealth through transparent self-declaration.

Key benefits include ending double taxation, boosting taxpayer inclusion, preventing capital flight, and creating stable, predictable government revenues. It reduces red-tapism, improves investor confidence, and encourages both domestic and foreign investment. By freeing government departments from duplicative monitoring, resources can be redirected toward nation-building. IMF studies suggest declaration-based models can raise compliance by 10–15% in developing economies.

The Wealth Declaration Model, therefore, provides a citizen-first, transparent, and sustainable solution to simultaneously resolve taxation complexity, corruption loopholes, and revenue instability, while fostering trust between citizens and the state.
