Abstract

This paper operationalizes the Wardhan Tax Doctrine, a package to stop penalizing wage labor while restoring progressivity at the top. On the labor side, it proposes a refundable Time Investment Credit (TIC) that converts verified upskilling hours into tax relief, as well as a Working Household Earned Income Exemption to remove low-to-moderate W-2 wages from federal income tax. On the capital side, it narrows preference stacks-e.g., §1(h) rates, §1014 step-up, §1031 deferral, §1061 carried interest, §1202 QSBS, §168(k) bonus depreciation, §199A pass-through, while strengthening the §1411 NIIT. Model statutory text and administrative design (Form 1098-L, random audits, basis information reporting) are included. The framework aims to shift the tax base from labor to ownership over time, with fewer distortions than historical high-rate systems, thereby aligning incentives for human capital formation and broad-based asset building.
