Abstract

Several studies have examined the relationship between attitude toward tax evasion and social class. However, those studies were limited to a single country. The results have been mixed. In some cases, tax evasion was found to be more acceptable among members of the lower social classes. In other studies, the exact opposite was found. A third group of studies found no significant relationship between social class and the acceptability of tax evasion. A fourth group of studies found that the relationship is curvilinear. The present study uses data from the most recent World Values Survey, which interviewed more than 125,000 people in nearly 80 countries. The survey included a question on attitude toward tax evasion. This study examines this data with the goal of determining if there is a correlation between social class and attitude toward tax evasion.

Keywords: tax evasion, social class, ethics, business ethics
