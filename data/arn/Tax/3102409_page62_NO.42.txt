Abstract

Dividends often impose taxes on investors. However, as certain prior financial models indicate, they also can produce a tax gain from leverage. Hence the composite marginal dividend tax rate can be specified as the nominal rate minus the offsetting tax gain from leverage. Although this principle has been embedded in theoretical models for more than forty years, no prior study has examined empirically whether the dividend-induced tax gain from leverage influences dividend policy. We address this empirical void and find dividends decrease in the nominal dividend tax rate and increase in the offsetting tax gain from leverage. In addition, we find the composite tax rate outperforms traditional measures in explaining dividend policy for our full sample of firms. Consistent with prior theory, we also find the composite rate varies in influence according to the financing source for a dividend.

Keywords: Dividend Tax, Tax Gain From Leverage, Tax Integration

JEL Classification: G32, H24, H25
