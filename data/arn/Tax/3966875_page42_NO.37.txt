Abstract

This paper shows that companies substitute debt and non-debt tax planning strategies. Room for interpretation in the tax law, which is necessary for the wide application of the law, creates 'legal uncertainty' and consequently opportunities for tax planning. Theory suggests these new opportunities for tax planning crowd out debt-based tax planning. I construct a novel measure of 'legal uncertainty' and show that 1 standard deviation higher 'legal uncertainty' is associated with 1.3 p.p. lower leverage, but higher non-debt tax planning. The net effect is a lower effective tax. The strength of these effects decreases in the probability of tax audits.

Keywords: Tax planning, Capital Structure, Corporate Taxation, Legal Uncertainty, Profit Shifting
