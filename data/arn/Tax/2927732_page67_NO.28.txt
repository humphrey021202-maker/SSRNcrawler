Abstract

We show that increases in stock loan fees have strong causal impact on stock prices. We identify these effects by exploiting exogenous variation in loan fees generated by a tax arbitrage opportunity that existed in Brazil from 1995-2014. The tax arbitrage involved differential tax treatment on dividend payments depending on investor's type. Our data set allows to distinguish between equity lending transactions motivated by tax-arbitrage from those with the purpose of short-selling the stock. Variation in loan fees on tax-motivated transactions were a source of repeated exogenous variation of borrowing fees in short-selling transactions.

Keywords: Short Selling, Short Selling Restrictions, Market to Borrow Stocks, Asset Pricing

JEL Classification: G12, G14
