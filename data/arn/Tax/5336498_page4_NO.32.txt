Abstract

We propose a novel method for assessing the amount of tax-motivated profit shifting and provide empirical evidence on the extent of profit shifting by European multinationals, addressing the 'known unknown' of how much these firms really avoid taxes in light of recent regulatory efforts against base erosion and profit shifting. By analyzing tax footnote disclosures in IFRS financial statements, we find a significant decline in profit shifting proxies after 2017. Our results further reveal considerable heterogeneity across firm sizes and countries, with smaller firms continuing to engage in profit shifting to some extent. This evidence is highly relevant for policy makers, highlighting the need for improved tax data in-frastructure and further evaluation of regulatory measures.

Keywords: Profit Shifting, Anti-BEPS Legislation
