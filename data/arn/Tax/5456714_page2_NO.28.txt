Abstract

This blog post examines the EU Commission's new proposal to include a new own resource levied as a contribution from operators in the internal market from an EU law perspective. It explains the proposal's basic functions and then discusses how it would change the budgetting of own resources and whether it could be considered a step towards more normativity in the EU budget.



Keywords: EU Law, EU Budget, EU Tax Law
