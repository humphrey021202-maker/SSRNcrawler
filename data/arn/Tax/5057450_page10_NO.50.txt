Abstract

We jointly analyze government choice of bankruptcy system and corporate tax rate in the economy where firms with investment projects select their capital structures and make liquidation/continuation decisions. The model predicts, for example, that for developped countries, a low tax rate can be combined with any bankruptcy system, intermediate tax rate-with creditors-friendly bankruptcy system and high tax rate-with shareholders-friendly system. The model also generates predictions for developing countries. Most of our predictions have not been tested sofar but are consistent woth some empirical evidence.
