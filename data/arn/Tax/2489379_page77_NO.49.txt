Abstract

While academic accounting journals publish research with potential policy implications, policy makers often do not consider these articles. Useful information currently being produced by accounting researchers can have a greater policy impact if it is effectively integrated, presented, and disseminated to policy makers. This paper offers five recommendations aimed at increasing the probability that pertinent academic tax accounting research will be used in the policy-making process: (1) integrate a discussion of the debate surrounding the tax policy issue under study into the manuscript, (2) offer detailed interpretations and implications of the research results, (3) proffer normative statements based on the empirical evidence, (4) provide a synopsis of the manuscript’s contribution to the policy debate via a structured abstract, and (5) utilize additional communication channels to increase the visibility of the academic research to those interested in tax policy.

Keywords: tax policy, international taxation, Pathways Commission, AACSB
