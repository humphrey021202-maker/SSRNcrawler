Abstract

In this article, the authors propose the debate of “evolutionary” international tax reform, inter alia, revisiting the current discussion on base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS), and suggesting a renewed emphasis on knowledge-based capital within the framework of the arm’s length principle in respect of transfer pricing and other specific anti-avoidance rules.
