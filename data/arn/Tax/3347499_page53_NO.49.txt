Abstract

To combat tax avoidance by multinational corporations, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development introduced country-by-country reporting, requiring firms to provide tax authorities with a geographic breakdown of their profitability and activity. Treating the introduction of country-by-country reporting in the European Union as a shock to private disclosure requirements, this study examines the effect on corporate tax outcomes. Exploiting the €750M threshold and employing a regression discontinuity and difference-in-difference design, I document a 1%–2% increase in consolidated GAAP effective tax rates of the affected firms. I also find some evidence consistent with a decline in tax-motivated income shifting starting in 2018. These results suggest that while private geographic disclosures can have a deterrent impact on overall corporate tax avoidance, the regulations have so far had a limited effect on tax-motivated income shifting. The findings of this study have important policy implications for the global implementation of private country-by-country reporting and add to the ongoing debate on public versus private disclosure of tax information.
