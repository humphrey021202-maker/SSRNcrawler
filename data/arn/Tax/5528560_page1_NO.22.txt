Abstract

Tariff increases to protect domestic markets reduce profit margins for firms that cannot pass these costs on to their customers. Taking the 2018 trade war between the U.S. and China as a setting, we find that pass-through restricted firms compensate for losses by planning taxes more aggressively and reduce effective tax rates by over 3 percentage points. However, importing firms, which face increased scrutiny, abstain from using the tax channel to compensate for losses when they risk losing government contracts. We document an economically and statistically significant unintended negative effect of tariff increases on government corporate income tax revenues.
