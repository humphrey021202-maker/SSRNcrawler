Abstract

This investigation explores how tax disputes influence voluntary auditor modification decisions among publicly exchanged businesses in Brazil-a nation where tax litigation consumes an unbelievable 75% of GDP, dwarfing the 0.28% average among OECD countries. Even though present literature examines tax litigation and auditing as independent domains, this exploration addresses the crucial intersection between these arenas using an extensive theoretical structure spanning accounting, taxation, and company governance. Using a sample of B3-detailed organizations from 2014 to 2023, we break down how provisions and uncertain commitments impact auditor rotation patterns through logistic regression modeling that accomplished 60% categorization precision with robust discriminatory power (ROC bend 71.05). Our discoveries uncover that tax litigation considerably raises the probability of voluntary auditor changes, with each unit increase in litigation strength raising modification possibility by 2.58 percentage points. Company size emerged as the strongest predictor, with larger organizations substantially more probable to launch changes, mirroring their intricate regulatory environments. Inversely, organizations audited by Big Four corporations and those functioning during the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated significantly lower modification probabilities, suggesting reputational worth and economic unpredictability promote audit relationship stability. Traditional monetary metrics-indebtedness, return on assets, and market evaluation-showed no substantial impact, highlighting how regulatory issues overshadow monetary considerations in Brazil's unique tax setting. These outcomes have considerable implications for company governance strategies, audit corporation specialization methods, regulatory policy development, and investor interpretation of voluntary auditor changes. Despite restrictions regarding measurement approaches and generalizability, the study contributes to recognizing how governance systems adapt to environments characterized by extraordinary tax complexity and litigation, providing insights for optimizing regulatory frameworks and corporate strategies in highly litigious contexts.

Keywords: Tax Litigation, Contingent Liabilities, Auditing, Voluntary Auditor Change, Corporate Governance
