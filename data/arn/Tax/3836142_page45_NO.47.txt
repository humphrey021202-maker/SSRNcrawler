Abstract

We investigate how local personal income taxes impact small business lending in the U.S. We use the staggered statutory changes of state tax rates as the identification to compare the loans granted in the adjacent counties across state borders using a matched dataset during 2001-2018. We find higher personal income taxes cause negative loan outcomes, including smaller loan size, shorter maturity, higher default probability and higher charge-off ratio. Higher taxes also lead to smaller aggregate amount and growth rate of small business loans granted. These findings suggest the tax-induced deterioration in borrower creditworthiness constrains local banks’ small business lending.

Keywords: Personal income taxes, state tax policy, banks, loans, small businesses, local credit markets

JEL Classification: G21, G32, H24, H81, J21, L25
