Abstract

The rapid digitization of the global economy has presented significant challenges to traditional international tax frameworks, prompting numerous jurisdictions to implement unilateral measures such as Digital Services Taxes (DSTs). Pakistan's Digital Presence Proceeds Tax Act, 2025 (DPPTA25), enacted to address tax base erosion from multinational digital enterprises, represents a notable addition to this evolving landscape. This article provides a comprehensive comparative analysis of DPPTA25 against similar digital taxation legislation in key international jurisdictions, focusing on definitions, scope, tax rates, collection mechanisms, compliance requirements, and enforcement measures.




The analysis reveals that DPPTA25, while sharing common objectives with other DSTs, distinguishes itself through a broader scope that includes digitally ordered goods, a lower transaction-based nexus for establishing digital presence, and highly interventionist collection and enforcement mechanisms, particularly involving payment intermediaries and Customs. These features indicate a robust and assertive approach to capturing digital economic value, potentially leading to enhanced revenue collection for Pakistan. However, they also introduce significant compliance burdens for affected businesses and intermediaries, raise data privacy considerations, and may invite international scrutiny, similar to challenges faced by other countries implementing unilateral digital taxes. The persistent adoption of such measures globally, despite ongoing multilateral efforts by the OECD, underscores the complex interplay between national fiscal sovereignty and the pursuit of a unified international tax system.
