Abstract

In addition to introducing fundamental changes to the structures of the European Union (EU) value added tax (VAT) rate regime, the EU VAT rate reform 2022 was aimed at aligning the EU VAT rate system with other EU policies, such as the European Green Deal. The environment-related measures are accordingly meant to incentivize eco-friendly supplies and, conversely, discourage environmentally harmful consumption patterns. Therefore, the EU lawmakers introduced options to apply zero, super reduced and/or reduced VAT rates, and a mandatory phasing-out of preferential VAT treatment respectively. Based on the empirical evidence from earlier VAT rate reforms, the author argues in favour of a differentiated assessment: While the effective VAT increases on the supply of certain environmentally harmful goods should send the intended price signal, the effectiveness and efficiency of VAT reductions as a means of promoting green consumption is highly questionable. In order to achieve the latter objective, public investments, direct financial aid, regulatory and targeted tax-related measures are identified as more appropriate measures.

Keywords: VAT; VAT rates; rate changes; environmental policy
