Abstract

The significance of changes to the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines after 2017 cannot be understated. Implementation of new activity-based concepts of value creation varies across OECD members, G20 countries and beyond, increasing risks of double-taxation. This requires wider adoption of MAP arbitration, within and beyond the OECD world.
