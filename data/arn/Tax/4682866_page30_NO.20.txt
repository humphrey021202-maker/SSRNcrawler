Abstract

Designing and implementing business models requires considering customer sentiments, but nomadic social enterprises lack sufficient research. This study examined factors affecting customers’ sentiments about a pop-up tax clinic serving unrepresented taxpayers to promote equality in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. During a tax year in the Northern Territory, Australia, a pop-up tax service collected 47 video-recorded customer feedback that was analysed. Independent variables were created using exploratory factor analysis, and customer sentiment scores were generated using XLSTAT software. The regression analysis provided empirical findings. The study found that offering free tax and excellent customer service positively impacted customer sentiment scores. The tax year did not have a significant influence. Holding tax clinics in busy shopping centres improved customer sentiment. This is the first study to examine customer sentiments about a nomadic social enterprise model, particularly a pop-up tax clinic. This study presents a new methodological approach for research proposing a theory between enterprises.
