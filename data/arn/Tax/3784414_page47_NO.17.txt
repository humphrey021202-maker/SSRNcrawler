Abstract

Behavioral Economics tries to understand how and why we, the people, make decisions in a world of uncertainty. Understanding decision-making mechanisms allows us to develop policies that increase the well-being of society. At the international level, there are experiences aimed at increasing voluntary compliance with tax obligations through the application of advances in behavioral economics. This work aims to make a synthesis of existing policies to know about their effectiveness and their possible application in other tax systems.
