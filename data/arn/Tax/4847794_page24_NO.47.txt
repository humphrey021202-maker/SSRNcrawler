Abstract

We examine income shifting dynamics by multinational Oil and Gas (O&G) firms, focusing on the impact of preferential tax treatments, dividend withholding taxes, and expanded tax disclosure requirements. Using a sample of 41,030 affiliate-year observations from 145 firms across 85 countries between 2007 and 2019, we document significant income shifting across jurisdictions. Additionally, we find a strong decline in this activity following the 2016 implementation of multilateral anti-tax avoidance measures, including the EU’s Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive and the OECD/G20’s BEPS (Base Erosion and Profit Shifting), suggesting the effectiveness of these reforms in curbing aggressive tax planning in the sector. We also show that income shifting is shaped by country-level fiscal policies. It is particularly less pronounced in countries offering substantial subsidies to the O&G sector and more prevalent in jurisdictions with high dividend withholding taxes. Finally, income shifting strategies respond to oil price fluctuations, underscoring the interaction between market conditions, regulatory reforms, and fiscal policy design.

Keywords: Multinational corporations, income shifting, O&G firms, tax planning
