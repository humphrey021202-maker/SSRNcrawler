Abstract

Leveraging an extensive dataset of U.S. private investment in public equity (PIPE) offerings, we investigate how investor capital gains tax rates influence PIPE offer prices. High capital gains tax rates correspond to lower offer prices than prevailing market rates. Unique data on PIPE investor identities, unavailable for initial public or seasoned equity offerings, reveals that this tax-price link weakens if investors bear significant capital losses in their non-PIPE stocks or already possess equity in the issuing firm. Moreover, the tax-price impact is lessened when PIPE issuers include investor protection terms in the contract or have a dividend history. A heightened capital gains tax rate elevates post-PIPE stock returns and reduces PIPE offering sizes. Subsample analysis shows this tax effect vanishing in instances of capital losses, where the offer price surpasses the closing price. In sum, our study bolsters the tax capitalization perspective on capital gains tax’s impact on stock prices.
