Abstract

Purpose: This study focuses on the factors influencing the performance of SMEs in Burao, Somaliland, where studies related to this topic are limited and scarce. Financial factors, infrastructure factors, technological capability, and government support were examined to test their influence on the performance of SMEs. Methodology: A cross-sectional study was employed, and our research design was explanatory and descriptive, with a quantitative approach. A sample of 373 SME owners and managers from the trading, construction, manufacturing, and service sectors was selected using simple random sampling methods. Data were collected through surveys and analyzed using STATA (version 17). The analysis employed descriptive statistics, multicollinearity tests, Pearson's correlation, and regression analysis to assess SME performance and the challenges faced. Findings: The study revealed that SME performance is negatively affected by financial constraints, insufficient government support, inadequate infrastructure, and limited technological capability. Correlation and regression analyses confirmed that these independent variables significantly and moderately influenced SME performance, supporting all hypotheses. Research limitations: This study faced limitations due to the scarcity of literature on factors influencing SME performance in Somaliland, particularly in the Burao District, which restricted comparisons with prior research. Future studies should examine additional factors, such as entrepreneurial orientation and innovation capability, especially in the context of external shocks such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, in-depth qualitative research using comprehensive interviews with managers is recommended to provide richer insights into the subject. Implications and recommendations: From a practical standpoint, SME managers are encouraged to improve performance by leveraging opportunities such as better access to finance, the adoption of appropriate technologies, and securing affordable electricity, each of which can enhance enterprise operations in different contexts. Government bodies, particularly the Ministry of Trade and Tourism and related agencies, should collaborate to reduce barriers for entrepreneurs by streamlining business registration processes, offering managerial training programs, and providing access to tax exemptions and other supportive policies.

Keywords: Financial Factors, Government Support, Technological Competence, Infrastructure
