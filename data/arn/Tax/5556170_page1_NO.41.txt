Abstract

This article proposes a regional tax governance structure for the Asia-Pacific, inspired by an African Union model. It advocates for an Asia-Pacific Tax Forum to empower developing countries, ensuring transparency and inclusivity through civil society involvement. The structure seeks to unify regional tax policies, enhancing Asia-Pacific influence in global tax discussions.
