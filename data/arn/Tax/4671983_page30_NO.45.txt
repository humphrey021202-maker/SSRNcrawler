Abstract

Border adjustment taxes like the value-added tax (VAT) are commonly regarded as establishing a level playing field for international competition. We employ a structural gravity model to analyse the VAT’s effects on trade in final goods in the European Union (EU). We find that the VAT is defacto non-neutral. A one percentage point VAT increase reduces aggregate imports and internal trade by 3.1% and implies a 1.8 to 5.4% reduction of imports relative to internal trade. Based on these findings, we conduct a counterfactual analysis and illustrate that VAT rate changes simply substantial welfare effects for an average country in the European Union.

Keywords: Structural gravity, value-added taxation, neutrality, discrimination, border adjustment

JEL Classification: F10, F14, H24
