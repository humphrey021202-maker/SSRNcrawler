Abstract

We study how tax policy shapes the cross-border spillovers of firms’ investments in artificial intelligence (AI). Using data on nearly 2,000 U.S. firms and their 40,000 European subsidiaries, we find that U.S.-based AI investment predicts growth in foreign subsidiary assets, revenues, R&D, and productivity. These effects are strongest in countries with R&D tax incentives and low corporate tax rates. Using a shift-share design, we document aggregate spillovers in European economies through both within-U.S. firm expansion and peer firm diffusion. Our findings reveal how tax policy attracts frontier technology investment via multinational firm networks.

Keywords: AI investment, intangible assets, growth, tax policy, tax competition, real effects of taxation
