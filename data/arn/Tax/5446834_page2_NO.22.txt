Abstract

Tax codes are not merely tools of revenue collection; they quietly reflect a nation's values. They show who deserves relief, which behaviors receive incentives, what burdens are shared, and how enforcement is pursued. These choices shape real decisions. Families consider tax burdens when deciding where to live. Businesses weigh tax incentives before investing. Cross-border professionals must manage obligations across multiple systems. By comparing the basic elements of two major economies at different stages of development—the United States (US) and India—this article offers a window into the thinking behind their tax frameworks. Although terminology and structures differ, a side-by-side, elemental comparison provides a useful reference point.

This article builds that reference. It begins with everyday concerns such as childcare, health, education, and dependent care, examining how each system treats essential costs of living. It then turns to the core of the tax base, including wages, investment income, and capital gains. The discussion then moves to administrative processes, covering how returns are selected for audit, how disputes are handled, and how technical expertise informs enforcement. Finally, the paper explores the treatment of cross-border income, focusing on how the two countries determine source, apply tax, and attempt to relieve double taxation. These comparisons throw light on the structural and philosophical choices that underlie India’s centralized model and the United States’ layered federal design, offering a practical guide for professionals and individuals engaged with both systems.

Keywords: India-US, Internation Taxation, Cross-Border Taxation, Tax Policy
