Abstract

We study tax evasion in a dynamic macroeconomic model where utility-maximizing entrepreneurs use capital to produce or buy bonds, depending on their firm's stochastic productivity. The government provides productivity-enhancing public goods financed through taxes and bond issuance. Entrepreneurs can increase their income by evading taxes at the risk of being audited and fined. Lower productivity boosts evasion incentives, exacerbating capital misallocation because low-productivity entrepreneurs accumulate wealth at their peers' expense. Consistently with the data, the model predicts a negative relation between tax evasion and productivity in the aggregate but heterogeneous signs and magnitudes across productivity levels. Public good provision can reduce tax evasion, but its efficacy depends (positively) on the severity of financial frictions.

Keywords: dynamic tax evasion; financial frictions; general equilibrium; heterogeneous agents; capital misallocation

JEL Classification: E25, E26, H23, H26
