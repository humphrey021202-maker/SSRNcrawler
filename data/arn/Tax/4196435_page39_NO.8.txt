Abstract

Using the 2008 corporate tax reform in China as a quasi-natural experiment, we find a behavioral asymmetry. Compared to firms whose taxes were unaffected by the reform, firms whose tax rate increased reported significantly lower profit margins to avoid paying more taxes. However, firms whose tax rates declined did not behave differently from unaffected firms. The asymmetric behavior is valid for private firms, but not for state-owned firms who have softer budget constraints. Managing costs of goods sold and other expenses, rather than manipulation of net receivable, is the main channel for the tax avoidance we document.

Keywords: Tax reform, Tax avoidance, Asymmetric behavior
