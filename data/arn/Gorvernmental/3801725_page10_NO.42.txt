The aim of this study is to ascertain the effect of self determination on budget related behaviour in federal universities in Nigeria. Ten universities were sampled from a population of twenty three eligible universities. Primary data was extensively relied upon using validated instruments through a self administered questionnaire. Both descriptive and inferential statistical tools of analysis were adopted. Results of linear regression indicated that elements of self determination significantly affected elements of budget related behaviour at beta=0.375; 0.462; beta=-0.052; beta=0.288)

Keywords: Participatory budgeting; propensity to introduce slack, motivators
