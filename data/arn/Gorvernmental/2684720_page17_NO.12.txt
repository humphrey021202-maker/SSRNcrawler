Abstract

U.S. immigrants often have the desire to give back in order to promote welfare in their countries of origin. The U.S. income tax law may permit a deduction for their contributions (IRC Sec. 170). A deduction is available when contributions are made to certain U.S. non-profit entities. These organizations may conduct part or all of their activities in a foreign country or make grants to another qualifying organization without geographic limitation. The following chapters discuss the standards that govern the aspects of international activities and grant making by U.S. charitable organizations.

Keywords: Charitable contributions, cross-border, international activities

JEL Classification: H2, L3, K34
