Pick and Roll: Expanded Roles for a State Auditor

Posted: 11 Jul 2019

Abstract

This paper proposes a theoretical typology for categorizing the multiple roles played by public auditing today, containing four audit modes: classic administrative audit; policy analysis audit; values-based audit; and public agenda audit. While some specific aspects of these functions have been studied in other contexts, they have not yet been examined and articulated as a whole. Using examples from Israel, this paper seeks to bridge this gap in the literature by presenting this evolution, offering a theoretical framework for identifying and discussing its new scope and their implications both for the future of the state audit and for democracy.

Keywords: Public Auditing, State Comptroller, Public Administration, Governance
