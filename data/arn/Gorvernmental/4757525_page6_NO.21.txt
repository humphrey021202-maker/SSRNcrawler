Abstract

This paper examines the effect of capitalising operating leases on the total liabilities to total assets and surplus to total asset ratios for a sample of New Zealand charities. It finds that both ratios have significantly increased post-capitalisation and that expenditures change. This extends the constructive lease capitalisation literature to the not-for-profit sector. This paper also discusses the characteristics of charities’ operating leases and how they differ from the for-profit sector. Overall, this paper provides timely evidence to standard-setters, especially considering the current exposure draft converging International Public Sector Accounting Standard lease accounting with International Financial Reporting Standard 16.

Keywords: IFRS 16, Leases, Charities, IPSAS

JEL Classification: M41, M48, L30
