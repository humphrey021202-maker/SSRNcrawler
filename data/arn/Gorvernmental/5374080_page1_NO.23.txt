Abstract

This comprehensive study explores the pivotal role of digital tools in enhancing transparency and accountability within the framework of urban governance.

By synthesizing established theoretical frameworks and presenting empirical findings from recent investigations, this article offers an integrative conceptual analysis that elucidates the opportunities and challenges associated with the digitalization of urban governance. The study aims to provide valuable insights for policymakers, urban administrators, and scholars interested in leveraging digital technologies to foster more open, responsive, and effective governance systems. This work serves as a foundational contribution to the growing field of digital urban governance and sets the stage for future empirical and policy-oriented research.
