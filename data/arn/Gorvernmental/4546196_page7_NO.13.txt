Abstract

This study critically evaluates the multifaceted socioeconomic ramifications engendered by the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) Law on the vulnerable nexus of low-income households and nascent small businesses in Zamboanga City, Philippines. The analysis delineates the intricate interplay between policy mandates and real-world outcomes. Empirical evidence substantiates that the TRAIN Law, through its recalibrated income tax structure and the concomitant alteration of excise taxes on essential commodities, has indeed led to a discernible amelioration in disposable income for low-income households. Notwithstanding this positive development, the law's simultaneous introduction of excise tax adjustments on petroleum products and sugary beverages has elicited incremental inflationary pressures that warrant prudential attention. Pertinently, the findings elucidate the disparities in adaptability exhibited by small businesses, as the weight of excise tax modifications manifests disproportionately across sectors. Informed by the empirical insights, it is advocated that a nuanced policy discourse acknowledges the inherently heterogeneous dynamics pervading Zamboanga City's socioeconomic fabric. The confluence of direct and indirect tax modifications has distinctively impacted households and businesses, necessitating a calibrated array of sector-specific interventions to bolster resilience and engender equitable growth. This study, encapsulating a comprehensive investigation into the implications of the TRAIN Law, contributes empirically-grounded insights to the taxation, local fiscal management and Public Administration discourses, underscoring the importance of tailored policy initiatives within the broader spectrum of fiscal reform.
