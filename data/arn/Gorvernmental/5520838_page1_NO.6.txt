Abstract

Cost efficiency remains a central determinant of corporate survival in competitive industries such as brewing. This study investigates the relationship between cost structure and profitability of Nigerian Breweries Plc from 2003 to 2024, employing both trend analysis and econometric techniques using E-Views. Profitability was proxied by operating profit, while cost structure was decomposed into material cost, labor cost, and overhead cost, alongside macroeconomic indicators such as inflation, exchange rate, and GDP growth. Descriptive statistics and autoregressive models were applied, complemented with SWOT and PESTEL analyses to provide strategic insights. The regression results revealed that material cost had a significant negative effect on profitability (p = 0.0388), while exchange rate (p = 0.0148) and GDP growth (p = 0.0544) positively influenced performance. Labor cost (p = 0.1900), overhead cost (p = 0.1174), and inflation (p = 0.1673) were statistically insignificant but exhibited directional effects consistent with theory. The overall model was statistically significant with Prob(F-statistic) = 0.0011, confirming that cost structure and macroeconomic variables jointly explain variations in profitability. Diagnostic tests showed no evidence of serial correlation (p = 0.6966) or heteroskedasticity (p = 0.3464), validating the model's robustness. It concludes that cost efficiency and macroeconomic stability are critical to sustaining profitability in the Nigerian brewery sector. The study focused on a single firm, which might limit how far the findings can be applied across the entire brewing industry. It recommends management to implement contemporary cost-control measures, diversify foreign exchange risk and invest in digital technologies and automation while lowering ongoing labor and overhead expenses.
