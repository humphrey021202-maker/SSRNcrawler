Abstract

In order to present a true and fair view of the property of public entities, public accounting law relies on the concept of asset, which is distinct from the concept of property. Although the concept of asset does not disregard legal ownership, it often exceeds it or ignores it in favour of economic ownership.

Keywords: economic ownership, legal ownership, property, assets, accounting, public accounting
