Abstract

This study examines the influence of earnings management on municipal bond ratings among U.S. local governments, particularly in the context of GASB 14 and GASB 34. Our findings indicate that municipalities engage in strategic financial reporting to improve their bond ratings, with frequent small increases in net income leading to an enhancement of 0.086 notches in initial bond ratings and 0.099 notches in total bond ratings. The effect is significantly magnified by six times when financial statements are disclosed prior to bond rating dates. Given that investors are inclined to hold bonds with high ratings, our analysis reveals that improved bond ratings, especially initial bond ratings, lead to high trading yields in the secondary market.

Keywords: Municipal Bonds, Governmental Accounting, Earnings Management, Bond Rating
