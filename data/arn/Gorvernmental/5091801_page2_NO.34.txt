Abstract

This study aimed to investigate the fiscal administration accountability practices of fiscal administrators in the municipal local government unit of Kasibu, Nueva Vizcaya, specifically for the fiscal year 2023. The focus areas included management, information and advice, control, accountability, and organization and processes. The study also assessed the individual work performance of the respondents, considering task performance, contextual performance, and counterproductive work behavior. Data for the research was gathered through questionnaires, and statistical procedures such as mean, Independent t-test, Pearson r, and coefficient of determination were employed to analyze the data. A significance level of 0.05 was set for testing all the hypotheses established in this study. This study investigates the perceptions of financial management accountability practices and work performance among employees and administrators. Both groups regard financial practices highly, with administrators holding a slightly stronger view. The overall grand mean score of 4.12 indicates a positive perception, particularly in the "management," "information and advice," and "control" dimensions. Work performance is assessed as very satisfactory, with employees showing slightly higher confidence than administrators. Respondents acknowledge their excellence in specific job tasks and contributions to the organization, though they recognize the need to reduce counterproductive behaviors for enhanced performance. Statistical analyses reveal no significant differences in perceptions of financial practices and work performance between administrators and personnel. A positive correlation between perceived financial management practices and individual work performance is evident. The study proposes Management Intervention Programs (MIPs) to improve accountability and work performance, alongside Training Design Guides (TDGs) for tailored human resource development.

Keywords: Fiscal administration accountability, work performance, training design guide
