Abstract

This article presents a model for budgetary allocation that was used by an international NGO for its aid program. The features of the model are explained and demonstrated. The model enables NGOs to allocate budgets based on impartial, objective and transparent criteria. It also presents explicitly the policy choices that face the NGO and allows staff and funders to evaluate the costs and benefits of their choices.

This article is now part of my new book: Measuring the things that count: Quantitative methods for the management of nonprofits. LAP Lambert Academic Publishing (January 25, 2010).

Keywords: NGO, aid, budget, allocation, PPP
