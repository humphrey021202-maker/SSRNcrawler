Abstract

For a number of years, Hungary's tax legislation was very stable. Significant changes, however, came into effect in 2021 and 2022, including, inter alia, in respect of corporate income tax, small business tax, personal income tax, benefits in kind, family allowances, social security rates and VAT. As the election in April 2022 confirmed the current government, it is unlikely there will be radical changes in the near future.
