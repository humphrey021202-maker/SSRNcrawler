Abstract

as a non-profit (non-profit) institution, the school. This charitable organization doesn't prioritize making money. Financial reporting is required of nonprofit organizations as a means of accountability for their operations throughout time. Financial accounting rules for non-profit entity financial statements have been released by the Indonesian Institute of Accountants (IAI). The Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Number 45 (Revised 2015), which addresses the financial reporting of nonprofit organizations, contains this standard. This study focused on RA Kartini, a non-profit organization and a member of KKG Cluster. This study intends to determine the extent of PSAK No. 45-compliant school financial reporting implementation. Then, because it provides a thorough explanation of the background, traits, and characteristics, the qualitative descriptive analysis method is applied.

Keywords: PSAK No.45, non-profit, finance report
