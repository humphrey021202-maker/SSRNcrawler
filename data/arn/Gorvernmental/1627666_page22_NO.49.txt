Abstract

A theoretical analysis is provided of the accounting framework and rules applied to the annual accounts of the European Communities (EC) since 2004. This accounting system draws upon International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) and is based on accrual accounting, under a dual integrated accounting process with the cash accounting that is maintained. It purports to shape the financial accounting and reporting of the supranational entity that are the EC. This entity carries out a wide range of policies and programs through the financial resources provided by the European Union Member States, making it accountable for incurred expenditure to these constituents. By analyzing the accounting conceptual framework and the sixteen specific rules, the paper assesses the capacity of its accounting system to provide a true and fair representation of the economy of the EC entity featured by that expenditure-sharing purpose, under the overall no-profit motive that is typical of every public administration.

Keywords: Public Sector Financial Accounting, Governmental Financial Accounting, Public Sector Accountability, Cash Basis, Accrual Basis, Modified Cash Basis, European Commission, accounting and economics of supranational organisations, conceptual framework

JEL Classification: H83, M48, M41, E02, P48
