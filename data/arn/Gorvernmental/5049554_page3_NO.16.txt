Abstract

Who should benefit from the billions of dollars in stimulus that federal grant spending creates when a government is broke and disaster strikes—creditors or communities? The Puerto Rico bankruptcy demonstrated that neither bankruptcy courts nor government grant-making agencies really know what to do in that situation, and that their actions created moral hazards that benefited its creditors post-Hurricane Maria. This article argues that giving communities the benefit of economic stimulus created by federal spending, especially in response to a disaster, makes more sense as a matter of Congressional grant policy and bankruptcy law. Doing so would meet bankruptcy law’s goal of ensuring the debtor has a fresh start and minimizes the need to seek bankruptcy protection in the future. While Congress can legislate changes to ensure that the situation in Puerto Rico never happens again, I also present several prescriptions that bankruptcy judges and agencies can implement in the absence of Congressional action.
