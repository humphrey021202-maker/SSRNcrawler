Abstract

This paper provides empirical evidence which informs contemporary debates on developing international financial reporting standards for not-for-profit organisations (NPOs) (CCAB, 2013a,b; IFRS Foundation, 2015). Drawing on a global survey with respondents showing experience of NPO reporting in 179 countries, we explore: practice and beliefs about NPO financial reporting internationally; perceptions of accountability between NPOs and stakeholders; and implications for developing international financial reporting standards. Interpreting our research in the context of accountability, we find considerable support for developing international financial reporting standards for NPOs, recognising broad stewardship accountability to all stakeholders as important, but prioritising accountability upwards to external funders and regulators.

Keywords: Not-for-profit organisations (NPO); accountability; international financial reporting; stewardship.

JEL Classification: M4
