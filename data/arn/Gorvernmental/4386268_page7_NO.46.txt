Abstract

In September 2021, the Texas legislature directed its state agencies to divest from investment companies that allegedly “boycott” energy stocks and announced a specific list of banned funds. We find that banned funds carry titles suggesting an environmental, social, and governance (ESG) focus. However, banned funds are largely indexers with a tilt slightly away from energy stocks and slightly toward technology stocks, compared with control funds. Banned funds earn higher risk-adjusted returns (alphas) before the ban, than control funds, and lower alphas after, but the differences are not economically significant. Red and blue states’ pension funds largely follow market trends and have similar exposures to energy stocks, even though their politicians proclaim pro- and anti-fossil fuel stances, respectively.

Keywords: ESG; Politics; Greenwashing; Texas; BlackRock
