Abstract

Within the last ten years, the New Zealand government has reformed itself from a system using antiquated management and accounting methods into a system that has attracted attention from government officials around the world. The new age methods adopted within the New Zealand government are based on a more business-like method of operations, and they include managerial empowerment, accrual accounting, asset revaluations, capital charging, and output budgeting. The changes in governmental financial reporting were made to support the new management methods. This paper provides a detailed review of how capital charging and asset revaluations are used within the New Zealand public sector. Additionally, it provides an explanation of why it would be very difficult to adopt these successful methods in governments founded on a U.S. constitutional model.

Keywords: New Zealand, Accrual accounting, Asset revaluation, Capital charging, Output budgeting, Management
