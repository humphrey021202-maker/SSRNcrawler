Abstract

Under New Public Management (NPM) we have seen an expansion of public accountability despite the fact that it is an ambiguous, complex, elusive, fragmented and heterogeneous concept. Public management has not only resulted in bureaucratic accountability being augmented by managerial accountability but also in greater awareness of political accountability which refers to the relationship between public sector entities and citizens or voters.

If we look at the relationship between public accountability and citizen trust, there are authors, who regard public accountability as a crucial factor for improving citizens’ trust (Kim 2005, p. 622; Fard/Rostamy 2007, p. 322). In contrast, by applying the principal agent theory, it can be argued that public accountability is mistrust-driven and therefore directed at identifying shortcomings in the performance of politicians or public managers. A further group regards it as ironic that NPM aimed at improving citizen trust but has institutionalized distrust into the public sector by introducing a complex system of contracts, fragmentation, short-term explicit standards of performance, numerous audits and inspection mechanisms.
