Abstract

This dissertation offers a comprehensive analysis of Pakistan’s federal budget for fiscal year 2025-26, evaluating the fiscal strategy supported by IMF-mandated reforms. With a total outlay of PKR 17.573 trillion, the budget shows a deliberate 7% decrease from FY 2024–25 levels, aligning with macroeconomic stability goals. Key targets include cutting the fiscal deficit to 3.9% of GDP (from 5.9%), achieving a primary surplus of 2.4%, and boosting GDP growth to 4.2%. Revenue measures aim to strengthen tax collection through digital enforcement and AI audits, raising the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) tax target to PKR 14.131 trillion, along with PKR 5.147 trillion in non-tax revenues. Defense spending increases by 20% to PKR 2.55 trillion (~2.5% of GDP), surpassing development allocations such as the PKR 1 trillion PSDP. Interest payments (PKR 8.207 trillion) and pensions (PKR 1.055 trillion) dominate current expenditure. The dissertation uses ratio analysis (deficit/GDP, debt servicing share), sectoral allocation comparisons, and benchmark comparisons with IFC standards and peers. Results show limited fiscal space for productivity-led priorities, especially education and health. Recommendations focus on broadening the tax base—particularly in agriculture and informal sectors—refinancing high-cost debt, redirecting resources toward human development, and strengthening implementation through the Uraan Pakistan strategy (five-year plan). The study concludes that while FY 2025–26 demonstrates disciplined fiscal consolidation, its success relies on proper execution and ongoing structural reforms.
