Abstract

This study replicates van der Kolk et al. (2019) to explore the impact of four types of management control (MC) on intrinsic and extrinsic motivation across Japanese local governments and for-profit firms. Surveying 677 government and 1,664 firm employees, we find: (1) personnel and cultural controls consistently enhance intrinsic motivation across sectors, demonstrating their broad applicability; (2) action controls promote intrinsic motivation in firms by supporting autonomy; and (3) results controls positively impact intrinsic motivation in governments, influenced by institutional factors. These findings suggest MC’s varied motivational effects, advancing understanding of its generalizability across institutional and sectoral contexts.

Keywords: self-determination theory, management control, intrinsic motivation, differentiated replication, survey
