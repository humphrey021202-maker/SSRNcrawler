Democratic Accountability During Performance Audits Under Pressure: A Recipe for Institutional Hypocrisy?

Forthcoming in Financial Accountability & Management Accounting

Posted: 3 May 2014

Date Written: May 1, 2014

Abstract

This study shows how the tensions between transparency and secrecy are likely to engender “institutional hypocrisy” in the accountability process taking place during Supreme Audit Institutions’ performance audits. The examination of relations between the French Cour des comptes, Administration and Parliament has revealed gaps between Administration and Parliamentarians’ discourse and action, secrets and things left unsaid. This impression of Administration and Parliamentarians’ full participation in this democratic process may give to citizens a false sense of security leading them to believe that accounts are indeed rendered, which is not actually the case. Rather, the appearances of functional democracy have been preserved.

Keywords: Court of Accounts, Parliament, Performance audit, Supreme Audit Institutions

JEL Classification: M4
