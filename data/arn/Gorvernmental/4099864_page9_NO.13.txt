Abstract

We explore determinants and implications of abnormal investment by local government politicians. We focus on two types of political influence hypothesized to drive capital asset investment: federal congressional influence and state government trifectas, whereby one political party holds the state governorship, senate, and house. Controlling for financing, demographics, and other economic factors, state government trifectas are associated with significantly more abnormal investment. Specifically, local government politicians invest significantly more in capital assets when state government trifectas are in place. Results are substantially stronger among the administrative overhead component of investment (e.g., administrative buildings) and for over- rather than under-investment, which suggests that abnormal investment is primarily inefficient. Additional analysis exploring trifecta political party effects finds no significant party differences overall. We also find that Republican trifectas in politically polarized states have substantially greater abnormal investment, while high polarization effectively constrains abnormal investment for Democrat trifectas. In contrast, we find little evidence that congressional influence affects local government investment. Further analysis suggests that local government politicians who invest in abnormally high investment levels are significantly less efficient in the future.
