Abstract

Budgetary accounting systems are crucial for budget management, financial accountability and economic policy decision making. Reforming a budgetary accounting system requires first analyzing its major weaknesses. This paper adopted an exploratory approach primarily relying on documentary evidence and comparative analysis to establish the weaknesses. It examined the basis of budgetary accounting in Nigeria to verify whether areas and liabilities are accurately monitored, payments reported in a transparent manner, accounting procedures clearly defined and enforced. Priority improvements in accounting should aim at consolidating the foundations for sound accounting. More complete budgetary accounting and disclosure of liabilities, of-budget receipts and outlays are needed. The progressive development of a modified cash-based budget and modified accrual accounting system should be considered favourably. Where conditions are conducive, a later stage in improving budgetary accounting could be the progressive or partial implementation of full accrual accounting system, beginning with agencies where it is more useful for assessing performance and generating financial information for national economic development.

Keywords: Budgeting, Accounting, Bases, Reform
