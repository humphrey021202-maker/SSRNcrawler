Abstract

We examine whether internal control problems are reflected in municipal bond markups. Government sector internal control problems are frequent, slow to be corrected, and increase the probability of future restatements, fraud, and waste of public resources. Using a generalized staggered difference-in-differences design, primary findings are that municipal bond markups are an economically substantial 8 –30 basis points higher during years when municipalities have a material weakness in internal controls. Markups are not significantly different during years when governments have significant deficiencies, suggesting the bond market does not differentiate more minor accounting problems. Findings are magnified under circumstances of greater information uncertainty, such as for revenue bond issuances and delayed release of financial information. Additional analysis suggests findings are primarily driven by retail investor trades, and more so when material weaknesses are disclosed in official statements. Moreover, bonds issued by governments with material weaknesses remain in underwriter inventory significantly longer before eventual sale to investors. Overall, our evidence has two primary implications: first, municipal bond markups reflect compensation to underwriters for the additional inventory holding risk and effort involved in placing bonds issued by municipalities with serious internal control problems; second, dealers may take advantage of retail investors by placing riskier bonds with them.
