Abstract

This research systematically analyses the discourse of quality in public policies and reforms of the UK National Health Service between 1983 and 2013. It identifies three distinctive periods in which this discourse is constructed differently, particularly in relation to the doctrines of New Public Management. Analysis of these periods shows that the discourse of quality is central both to the movement of administrative doctrines after, if not quite beyond, New Public Management, and to a changing relation between medical professionalism and administrative reform. This illuminates a wider significance of quality in administrative change than currently understood.

Keywords: Quality, Healthcare, Discourse, New Public Management, Professionalism
