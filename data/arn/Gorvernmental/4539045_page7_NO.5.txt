Abstract

This article examines whether the political budget cycle exists among local governments in Indonesia, which are characterized by limited discretion in revenue generation, high financial dependence, and low levels of debt. Using 4,769 financial statements of local governments from 2008 to 2018, the authors found that budget surplus and cash holdings were lower before election years, confirming the relatively higher government expenditures by incumbents in the years leading up to an election. Political budget cycles were found to be stronger when mayors were eligible for re- election and when local governments were relatively less developed.

Keywords: Budget surplus, cash holding, Indonesia, local government, political budget cycle, young democracy
