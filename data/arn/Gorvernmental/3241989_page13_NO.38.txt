Abstract

A vast majority of research on the Information Technology (IT) decision making in the university uses the case study research methodology. However, many of these case studies are done in a stand-alone manner. This article demonstrates a research methodology on using more than one case study on the IT decision making at university. In addition, this article demonstrates how Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) could be used to complement the multi-case study analysis of IT decision making at university. The article uses a hypothetical example to demonstrate the research methodology to conduct multi-case research on the IT project selection in university. Next, it demonstrates how QCA could be used to complement the case study research, by analyzing how the IT project selection conditions in university lead to an outcome.

Keywords: Research Methodology, Case Study, Multiple Case Studies, Qualitative Comparative Analysis, QCA, Information Technology, IT, IT governance, IT governance in university, IT project selection, IT project selection in university, condition, outcome, centralized IT decision, decentralized IT decision, IT
