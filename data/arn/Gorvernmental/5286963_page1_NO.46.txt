Abstract

The United States healthcare system represents one of the most complex and expensive healthcare delivery models in the world, accounting for $4.9 trillion in spending in 2023, equivalent to 17.6% of the nation's Gross Domestic Product. This comprehensive analysis examines the intricate cost structures, evolving delivery models, and transformative potential of artificial intelligence within the American healthcare landscape. The U.S. healthcare system is characterized by a unique blend of public and private financing mechanisms, with private insurance accounting for 30% of total spending ($1.46 trillion), Medicare contributing 21% ($1.03 trillion), and Medicaid representing 18% ($872 billion). Despite this substantial investment, the system faces persistent challenges including 25.3 million uninsured Americans, significant geographic and demographic disparities in access and outcomes, and cost growth that consistently outpaces economic expansion.
