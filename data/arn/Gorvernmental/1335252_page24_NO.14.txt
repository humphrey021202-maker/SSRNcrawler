Abstract

Nonprofit organizations are under considerable pressure to be efficient fund raisers. Prior research indicates that creative accounting methods are sometimes used to put the best possible face on performance. This paper skeptically examines the accounting for two well known series of charitable walks.

The Avon Products Foundation adopted extremely aggressive accounting for joint costs in 2003, allowing it to claim compliance with watchdog group guidelines for fund-raising efficiency and program spending.

The Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation reports only the net proceeds it receives from similar breast cancer walk events, improving its apparent fundraising efficiency.

Keywords: nonprofit organizations, accounting, special events

JEL Classification: L31
