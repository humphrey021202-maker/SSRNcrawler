Abstract

In 2011, the Spanish government made sustainability accounting mandatory for public sector organizations. This paper documents how, despite the new law, the level of sustainability accounting practices remains low. Following Thomson et al.’s (2014) insights and based on qualitative interviews, we explain this inactivity by the lower ambition of the sustainability programmes of the recent Spanish governments and by the reliance on generic accounting sustainability hybrids, i.e. the GRI guidelines.
