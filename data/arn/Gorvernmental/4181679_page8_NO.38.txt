Abstract

In 2010, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB) proposed Rule Change SR-MSRB-2010-03 (the Rule Change), which requires a display of municipal bond credit ratings on the EMMA website, a centralized repository of municipal bond information. This Rule Change modestly improved retail investor access to credit ratings because prior to the Rule Change, credit ratings were freely available on rating agencies’ websites. A difference-in-difference analysis reveals this modest rule change nonetheless results in an economically meaningful reduction in investor transaction costs of approximately 8 basis points on average. This transaction cost reduction exists only for retail investors (the intended beneficiaries of the Rule Change) and is concentrated in long-maturity bonds (where credit rating information is most useful). Moody’s ratings were posted on EMMA later than S&P Global and Fitch’s ratings and I find attenuated treatment effects for Moody’s when credit ratings from other rating agencies already exist on EMMA.

Keywords: processing costs; retail investors; municipal bond market; credit ratings; EMMA; MSRB
