Abstract

Many tax-exempt hospitals generate substantial profits.  At the same time, regulations prohibit them from having shareholders and distributing earnings to shareholders, leaving managers with unusual discretion over resources.  This combination makes them especially prone to agency problems.  Because hospitals play a central role in the U.S. economy, the costs of weak governance extend well beyond the sector itself.  In our analysis, tax-exempt hospitals spend more on administrative wages and capital investments than comparable taxable hospitals, but show no gains in financial or mission-driven outcomes.  A novel, hand-collected measure of state oversight reveals that stronger rules discipline finances but leave mission alignment unchanged.

Keywords: Nonprofit, Governance, Ownership Structure
