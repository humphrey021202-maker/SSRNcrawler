Abstract

We examine the issue of endogeneity in government accounting research. Estimation bias and inconsistency can arise when single equation estimation includes an explanatory endogenous variable. We discuss the modeling and estimation issues involving endogenous explanatory variables and we illustrate alternative specification tests for explanatory endogeneity when a system of equations includes a qualitative dependent variable, a common feature in government research. Our specification testing confirms the presence of endogeneity bias in a model used to estimate auditor reputation and audit fees in the government sector. We conclude the paper by offering suggestions for research where examining or considering explanatory endogeneity using simultaneous equations may be appropriate in other government settings.

Keywords: government audits, municipal audit fees, endogeneity bias, simultaneous equations

JEL Classification: M49, C35, H79
