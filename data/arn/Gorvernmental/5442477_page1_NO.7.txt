Abstract

Regulatory audits across domains, such as taxation, healthcare, and labor, are often framed as neutral oversight mechanisms; however, they operate as asymmetric games where auditees bear disproportionate risk and auditors wield unchecked discretion. The Lopez Theory of Asymmetric Enforcement (LTAE) introduces a game-theoretic framework that exposes and corrects these systemic imbalances. Anchored in lived experience and formal modeling, LTAE diagnoses how institutional memory, incentive skew, and interpretive monopolies distort compliance into coercion.

To operationalize fairness, the paper presents the Lopez Audit Anchor Model (LAAM), a modular architecture that embeds strategic memory, dynamic fairness thresholds, and bias-aware Bayesian inference into the audit lifecycle. LAAM redefines enforcement as a repeated asymmetric game, where anchors decay over time, forgiveness is algorithmically triggered, and auditor discretion is logged for transparency. Simulations suggest LAAM can reduce redundant audits by over 40%, increase voluntary compliance, and restore trust through a new Nash equilibrium where fairness becomes the rational strategy.

This work offers not just a critique but a blueprint complete with Python implementations and simulation logic for transforming audits from punitive inertia into adaptive, ethical oversight. It is a call to reimagine enforcement as a system that learns, forgives, and evolves.
