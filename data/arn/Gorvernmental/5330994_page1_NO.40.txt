Abstract

Information-based regulations are often designed to benefit the public at large. However, there is significant heterogeneity in the public's ability to integrate information. This paper examines how such heterogeneity shapes firms' environmental outcomes under the Toxic Release Inventory Program in the U.S. We leverage the staggered release of the "Report on Carcinogens" as a quasi-natural experiment, which shifts the public's perceptions of chemical risks specifically related to cancer. Although pollution has been disproportionately concentrated in disadvantaged communities, firms only reduce emissions and implement quality abatement in higher-status areas after their reported chemicals are identified as possible carcinogens. Additional analyses suggest that these uneven corporate responses are shaped by differences in media coverage and civic engagement. We also find that regulators' targeted intervention has a limited impact on improving such conditions. Overall, we highlight a hidden outcome of information-based environmental regulations: by enabling selective responses, corporate environmental information may exacerbate existing disparities in the distribution of economic resources and environmental risks.

Keywords: Information-Based Regulation, Distributional Impact, Toxic Release Inventory, Carcinogens, Pollution Abatement
