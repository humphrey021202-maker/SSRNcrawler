Abstract

This article presents a systematic thematic review of the global literature on accrual accounting in the public sector. While accrual accounting is promoted for its potential to enhance transparency, accountability, and fiscal comparability, its implementation across jurisdictions reveals a landscape of complexity, variation, and persistent challenges. The review synthesizes recent academic research and organizes the findings into four core themes: (1) implementation and institutional context, (2) technical and resource challenges, (3) measurement, reporting, and decision-making, and (4) risk, integrity, and system resilience. Evidence shows that adoption is shaped by national legal frameworks, administrative traditions, and political environments, with no single pathway to reform. Technical and human resource constraints, educational gaps, and IT limitations frequently hinder effective implementation and sustainability. Furthermore, issues related to reporting complexity, lack of standardization, and conceptual frameworks limit the practical utility of accrual information for decision-making and public accountability. Risks such as earnings management, reconciliation difficulties, and crisis-induced vulnerabilities are also identified. The review concludes that while accrual accounting offers substantial promise for public sector financial management, realizing its full benefits requires holistic reform strategies, ongoing capacity-building, and adaptive governance tailored to each context.

Keywords: Accrual Accounting, Public Sector, Accountability, Implementation Challenges, Financial Management
