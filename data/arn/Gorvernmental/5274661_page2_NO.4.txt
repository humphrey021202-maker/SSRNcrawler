Abstract

We examine the sensitivity of municipal cash flows and investment to temperature. More uncomfortably hot temperatures predict lower municipal revenues, particularly to the extent that areas have few or more concentrated revenue sources or rely on non-property tax revenues.  Municipalities offset revenue shocks with dollar-for-dollar changes in current-year expenditures. Capital expenditures exhibit 2.5 times the sensitivity of operating expenditures, a result we qualitatively support via a survey of municipal managers. Revenue concentration and composition strongly predict the effect of temperature on both revenues, capital expenditures and total spending, which municipalities do not appear to manage via intergovernmental transfers, debt offerings, or subsequent year’s spending. These findings challenge conventional notions of governmental inflexibility, suggesting that municipalities actively manage financial risks. 

Keywords: Municipal financing, cash flow shocks, investment, municipal budgeting, climate change, climate change
