Abstract

When COVID-19 hit the U.S. in early 2020, individuals aged 65+ were identified as a higher risk population. In Florida, Governor DeSantis issued Emergency Order 20-006 to prohibit visitation to facilities housing groups of high-risk people, including assisted living facilities (ALFs). Regardless, 672 ALFs of the 3,119 in Florida had reported at least one positive case of COVID-19 by a resident or staff member as of June 30, 2020. Prior research has highlighted the differences in service delivery between nonprofits and for-profits. This manuscript fills the void of minimal research on nonprofit service delivery during a pandemic. We find that nonprofit ALFs have experienced fewer positive cases of COVID-19 among their residents, but there is no difference between nonprofit and for-profit ALFs in terms of resident deaths. We also find evidence that ALF staff are infecting residents, and the provision of nursing services matters for protecting ALF residents from COVID-19.
