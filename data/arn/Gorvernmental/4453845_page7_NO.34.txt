Abstract

Using e-filed IRS Form 990 data, I construct a novel measure of unrestricted cash windfalls from private contributions to examine how charitable nonprofits allocate funds following these events. The findings suggest that windfall nonprofits invest in long-term organizational infrastructure, increase staffing, and expand both administrative and program-related spending. These patterns are consistent with windfalls being used to enhance both administrative and program-related capacity. The results are generally robust to alternative windfall specifications and provide new insight into how nonprofits manage unrestricted funding. Additional analysis suggests that some boards of directors play an active role in managing windfalls by designating a portion for future use. The implications of this study’s findings are also discussed.

Keywords: Nonprofit, Unrestricted Cash Windfalls, Program Spending, Organizational Infrastructure

JEL Classification: L31
