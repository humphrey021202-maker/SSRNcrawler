Abstract

This study provides a critical case-based examination of Sri Lanka's outdated parcel clearance procedures, highlighting the persistence of bureaucratic inef iciencies in the face of global digital transformation. Through a irst-hand account of the time-consuming process required to collect a non-commercial academic journal, the paper illustrates how manual systems, redundant veri ication layers, and excessive internal checks continue to burden professionals, particularly academics. These outdated procedures represent not merely operational inef iciencies but a structural resistance to reform, undermining Sri Lanka's ambitions to become a knowledge-based economy. Drawing on comparative international best practices and using a lexible, iterative research model, the paper argues for the urgent need to adopt digital customs clearance systems and shift toward risk-based facilitation models. The indings contribute to the discourse on public sector reform, e-governance, and institutional modernization, calling for systemic transformation to enhance national competitiveness and service delivery.
