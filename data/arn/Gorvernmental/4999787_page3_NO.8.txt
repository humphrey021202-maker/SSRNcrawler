Abstract

Portuguese Abstract: O objetivo desse estudo é identificar o posicionamento dos autores de pesquisas recentes sobre o tema adoção das International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) nos Estados Unidos da América (EUA). Selecionou-se 19 artigos relacionados com a temática proposta nas bases Business Source Complete e Web of Science, desde o ano de 2012 até os mais recentes. Utilizou-se o Mapeamento Sistemático para atingir os objetivos propostos na problemática. Constatou-se que as temáticas abordadas pelos artigos são semelhantes. Os resultados indicaram que nove dos artigos analisados apoiam a harmonização contábil nos EUA, nove são neutros e apenas um autor se posicionou contra. Visto que a maior parte (95%) dos artigos ou defendem ou não se opõem à adoção das IFRS nos EUA, pressupõe-se que os benefícios sugeridos com a adoção completa tendem a superar os custos, embora não haja nenhum posicionamento das entidades reguladoras que afirme a necessidade de incorporar as IFRS nos relatórios financeiros dos EUA e quando isso deve ocorrer. Os órgãos reguladores devem ser encorajados a utilizar um método que permita a consistência e comparabilidade nos relatórios financeiros em US GAAP (United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) e IFRS.

English Abstract: The objective of this study is to identify the position of the authors of recent research on the adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in the United States of America (USA). There were selected 19 articles related to the subject proposed in the bases Business Source Complete and Web of Science, from the year 2012 to the most recent ones. Systematic Mapping was used to achieve the objectives proposed in the problem. It was found that the themes addressed by the articles are similar. The results indicated that nine of the articles analyzed support accounting harmonization in the USA, nine are neutral and only one author has opposed it. Since most (95%) of the articles either defend or do not oppose the adoption of IFRS in the USA, it is assumed that the benefits suggested by full adoption tend to outweigh the costs, although there is no assert that IFRS should be incorporated into USA financial reporting and when this should occur. Regulators should be encouraged to use a method that allows for consistency and comparability in US GAAP (United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) and IFRS financial reporting.
