Abstract

In this paper the authors analyse implementation of the fund accounting concept in the process of managing non-profit organisations. Control of budget, that is, funds can be ensured by implementing various concepts, including, inter alia, the fund accounting concept. Although its implementation has a long history in the USA and other developed countries, developing countries start paying more attention to the use of public funds and other resources in non-profit organisations only in later stages of development. The paper will highlight the main advantages and disadvantages of this concept, with a view to considering possible introduction of the concept into official or unofficial financial reporting of non-profit organisations in the Republic of Serbia.

Keywords: non-profit organizations, funds, control, accounting
