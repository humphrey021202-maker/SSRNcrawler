Abstract

This study explores the barriers to digital inclusion faced by women entrepreneurs in the unorganized sector, with a focus on identifying and prioritizing these barriers using the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method. The unorganized sector, comprising a significant portion of small-scale enterprises, often faces unique challenges in terms of access to technology, digital literacy, and infrastructure. These challenges are further exacerbated by socio-cultural norms, financial constraints, and insufficient support systems. Through a multi-criteria decision-making approach, this research assesses the impact of various barriers, such as affordability, digital literacy, cultural perceptions, and infrastructure gaps, and provides insights into how these can be addressed. The results demonstrate that affordability and digital literacy are the most pressing barriers, followed by cultural and infrastructure challenges. The findings suggest targeted interventions in the form of affordable training, financial support, and community-based solutions to improve digital inclusion and empower women entrepreneurs in this sector.

Keywords: Digital Inclusion, Women Entrepreneurs, Barriers, TOPSIS
