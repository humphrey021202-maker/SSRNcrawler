Abstract

The goal of this ‘Green Paper’ is to contribute, in a neutral way, to a conversation that has been going on for some time amongst a variety of actors, concerning whether mandatory reporting standards are a prerequisite for effective ‘sustainability’ or ‘nonfinancial’ corporate reporting. Specifically, we ask whether the existing standard-setting regime for financial reporting – that of the US Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) – should be extended to include setting standards for nonfinancial information.
