Abstract

Health care costs in the United States make up a larger proportion of gross domestic product than in any other developed country and continue to rise. We examine whether the use of consistent costing information across hospitals (“costing information consistency”, or CIC) provides one avenue to reduce these costs. We empirically measure CIC at the hospital level by identifying how many other hospitals in the hospital group to which the hospital belongs also use the same costing system vendor. Using M&A activity among costing system vendors as an instrument for exogenous changes in hospital CIC, we find that increased cost comparability from CIC leads to economically significant decreases in hospital costs. These cost reductions appear to be achieved without compromising quality of care. We find no significant association between CIC and declines in patient satisfaction, mortality, or readmission rates. Reductions in expenses as the result of CIC are concentrated in non-clinical services such as administration, medical records, and housekeeping. 

Keywords: cost management, costing system, information system integration, value-based care
