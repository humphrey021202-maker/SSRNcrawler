Abstract

Water is an important resource as well as a constraint to urban development. Given variation over space and time, urban water resource management often calls for an integrated approach toward it. Resource accounting is such prudent method of water management in the urban context. This paper argues for using water accounting as an appropriate tool for decision-making in water resource management through an illustrative case study of NCT-Delhi. This framework of resource accounting shall be adopted by the urban water authority (or the urban local government authority) and implemented to achieve the goals of water management cost effectively. An institutional framework for policy and decision making using water resource accounts is also delineated.

Keywords: water resources accounting, urban water, water resource management, policy making, institutional framework
