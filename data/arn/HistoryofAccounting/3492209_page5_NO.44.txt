Abstract

We’ve approached the modern audit’s condition in Kazakhstan by reestablishing the history of its development since inception. We’ve analyzed the problems of IFRS adoption, compared them to the developed region’s (Germany) ones. We’ve concluded that the need for convergence grew from evolution (internationalization) of highly developed German economy, while in Kazakhstan, convergence took place as a means for economic growth. Afterwards, we’ve analyzed the effect of Big 4 presence in Kazakhstan, which changed the whole country’s audit system.

Keywords: Kazakhstan, ex-USSR, public audit, history of audit, big four, Chamber of Auditors, IFRS, ISA, financial accounting, IFAC

JEL Classification: M42
