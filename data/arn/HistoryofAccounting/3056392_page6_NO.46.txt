Abstract

The accounting profession is at a crossroad as a result of serious conflicts generated by its failure to properly situate itself as a true profession, its heavy reliance on credentialism, its role in the fragmentation of knowledge and services in the accounting firm, its tenuous positions in courts, its failure to resist deprofessionalization drive, and its failure to be adequately regulated.

Keywords: credentialism, fragmentation of kniowledge, positions in courts, deprofessionlization

JEL Classification: M40
