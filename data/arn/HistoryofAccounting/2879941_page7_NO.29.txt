Abstract

Against the background of worries regarding ageing populations, expensive medical technologies and health-care costs which exceed 10% of GDP in many developed countries, the hospital has recently emerged as an important site for accounting research. The vast majority of research in this area has examined the roles and effects of accounting practices in contemporary hospital settings (e.g. Chua 1995; Lowe 2000; Kurunmaki 2004; Llewellyn and Northcott 2005). The history of hospital accounting, alternatively, has attracted much less interest, despite its significant potential to help us develop a better, more historically grounded understanding of the financial issues facing hospitals in the present as well as in the past.
