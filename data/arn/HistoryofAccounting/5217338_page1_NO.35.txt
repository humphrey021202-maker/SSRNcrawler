Abstract

This study investigates whether financial officials in the Song Empire (960–1279 CE) received higher economic rewards, despite Confucian norms emphasizing moral cultivation over material gain. The Song bureaucracy operated a salaried army and complex fiscal administration without specialized accountants, relying on Confucian literati resistant to technical specialization. This setting provides a natural context to examine how economic incentives supported skill acquisition and effective administrative performance.
A person-level dataset from the China Biographical Database (CBDB) is analyzed using CatBoost, a machine learning algorithm suited for incomplete historical records, combined with SHAP and Estimated Marginal Means (EMMs) to produce interpretable results. Controls include age, entry pathway, historical prominence, and social networks.
Results show that officials with financial experience systematically achieved higher salary ranks than comparable peers, indicating that fiscal appointments carried distinct economic rewards. The study contributes to accounting research by demonstrating how data-driven methods can reveal historical incentive structures, clarify the evolution of fiscal expertise, and highlight the interplay between expertise, rewards, and bureaucratic performance.

Keywords: Professionalisation, Accounting Profession, History, Quantitative Method, Sung Empire, CatBoost
