Abstract

We examine the effects of recognizing environmental remediation liabilities in financial statements on firms' pollutant output when the firms' detailed pollutant data is already publicly available. Since 1986, industrial facilities in the U.S. have reported to the EPA, by chemical compound, the amount of toxins released into the environment. In 1996, the AICPA released Statements of Position 96-1, which led some firms to increase the recognition of environmental remediation liabilities associated with the released toxins. We find that facilities most impacted by SOP 96-1 reduce total onsite emissions by 28% in the years after the SOP adoption. Emission reduction is most pronounced for ground pollution, and evidence suggests that facilities reduce emissions through waste management processes rather than abatement activities. Firms most affected by SOP 96-1 experience abnormal negative stock market returns and a decrease in bidask spread when the additional liabilities are recognized in their 10-K filings, consistent with market discipline facilitated by reduced information asymmetry. Overall, our study highlights a role for recognition of pollution-related liabilities in reducing pollution.

Keywords: recognition, pollution, environmental remediation liabilities, SOP 96-1

JEL Classification: G14, M14, M41, M48, Q53
