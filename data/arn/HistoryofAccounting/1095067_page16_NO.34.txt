Abstract

None of the top 40 journals used by Hasselback, Reinstein, and Schwan to rank accounting's prolific authors list ethics as an area of interest for manuscripts. Consequently, those who publish in ethics are at a competitive disadvantage in Hasselback et al.'s rankings. The purpose of this research is to provide a list of accounting's ethics authors as a companion study to Hasselback et al.'s rankings. In this study, 22 ethics journals were analyzed for the 35-year period (1968-2002). While a similar level of coauthoring occurs as in Hasselback et al. only 6.3 percent of accounting's assistant professors and above, who teach at schools in North America, have one or more publications in the 22 ethics journals this research examines.
