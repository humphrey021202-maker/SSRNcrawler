Abstract

The basic premise of this paper is that academic accountants and financial accounting standard setters have traded places in their normative vs. positive orientations. Academics have shifted from normative to positive, while standard setters have shifted from positive to normative. This paper was developed from a speech given at the August 2012 American Accounting Association Annual Meeting, which was followed by speeches by Ross Watts, Richard Macve, and Steve Zeff on the same subject. Ross Watts argued that a lack of understanding about accounting history and evolution is a likely source of problems. He also summarized the recent evidence in Allen and Ramanna (2013) on the association between standard setters’ backgrounds and the positions they take. Richard Macve added UK and IFRS perspectives (Macve, 2013), and Steve Zeff provided a more in-depth historical perspective (Zeff, 2013).

Keywords: accounting standard setting, accounting regulation, accounting research, accounting academics
