Abstract

We map the structure of corporate governance field by using co-citation analysis. We retrieve 432 papers published between 1983 and 2008 in 15 leading journals in the disciplines of accounting, finance, and management. We take the management discipline as an example, using a bibliographic data of papers published in five leading management journals. Our results provide a map of the structure of corporate governance field that is potentially useful to scholars for a variety of purposes, such as developing pedagogy, facilitating interdisciplinary research and creating knowledge.

Keywords: corporate governance, structure of knowledge, doctoral pedagogy, co-citation analysis

JEL Classification: G30, A23, C49
