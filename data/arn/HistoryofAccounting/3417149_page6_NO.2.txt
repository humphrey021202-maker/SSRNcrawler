Abstract

We commemorate the 50th anniversary of Ball and Brown [1968] by chronicling its impact on capital market research in accounting. We trace the evolution of various research paths that post-Ball and Brown [1968] researchers took as they sought to build on the foundation laid by Ball and Brown [1968] to create a body of research on the usefulness, timeliness, and other properties of accounting numbers. We discuss how those paths often link back to the groundwork laid and questions originally posed in Ball and Brown [1968].

Keywords: Ball and Brown, earnings, earnings-return relation, earnings usefulness, earnings timeliness, asymmetric timeliness, conservatism, association study, event study, information content, value relevance, positive economics, efficient markets hypothesis, market efficiency, post-announcement drift

JEL Classification: M41, G10, G14
