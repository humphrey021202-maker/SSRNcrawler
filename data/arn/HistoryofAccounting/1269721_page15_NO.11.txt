Abstract

This article reminds the reader that companies must produce their output efficiently, or else they will become high-cost producers and get competed out of existence. This article quotes published research to show that adoption of models other than historical cost (including fair value accounting) moves companies away from efficient production of their output.

Keywords: Fair value accounting, Efficient production, What the accounting profession knew

JEL Classification: D21, D61, E23, J44, M41, M44
