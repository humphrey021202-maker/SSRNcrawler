Abstract

Modern economic history literature has extensive coverage of the Overend,

Gurney crash of 1866 and the associated Lender of Last Resort operations

of the Bank of England.  But it basically ignores the giant British

investment mania of the 1860s that led to that crisis and to the crisis

of 1867 that followed.  Yet that mania has many other interesting

features that are relevant for dealing with bubbles.  In particular,

that historical episode shows that high interest rates may not suffice

to deflate a bubble.  It also demonstrates the dangers of "financial

innovation," which flowered in that period and enabled promoters to

mislead and ruin investors in novel ways, while producing a rapid

expansion of the railway system that escaped public notice.  Even some

of the most sophisticated contemporary observers, such as Walter Bagehot,

who were bothered by the market anomalies they saw, were deceived by that

pioneering "financial engineering" which has strong similarities to the

one that led to the Global Financial Crisis of 2008.  This paper points

out some of the many neglected aspects of that mania.  Those include

an illustration of the evolution of economic thought towards ignoring

underlying causes of financial crises and concentrating just on the

panics in which they culminate.

Keywords: Bagehot, bubbles, panic of 1866

There were actually two contractor firms, Peto and Betts, and the smaller Peto, Betts, and Crampton. For simplicity they are here grouped under the name Peto. Peto was one of the two largest contracting firms in the world at that time. The other one, Brassey's, survived
