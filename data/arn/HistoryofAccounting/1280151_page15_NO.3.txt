Abstract

Corporate defence represents an organisation's program for self defence or self protection. This paper explains the concept in more detail and explores where business continuity fits into the corporate defence paradigm. The changing nature of corporate defence in the 21st century is discussed and the resulting opportunities which present themselves for those involved in business continuity initiatives are identified. The paper is designed to provoke a certain degree of thinking outside the box and encourage future progress in this area.

Keywords: Corporate defence, defense, governance, risk management, compliance, intelligence, security, resilience, controls, assurance, audit, investigations

JEL Classification: G20, G30, L20, M14
