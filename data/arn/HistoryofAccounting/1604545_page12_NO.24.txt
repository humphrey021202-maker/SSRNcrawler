Abstract

This paper ranks individual accounting researchers based on their research productivity in the most recent 6, 12, and 20 years. We extend prior individual faculty rankings by providing separate individual faculty research rankings for each topical area commonly published in accounting journals (AIS, audit, financial, managerial, and tax). In addition, we provide individual faculty research rankings for each research methodology commonly used by accounting researchers (analytical, archival, and experimental). These findings will be of interest to potential doctoral students and current faculty, as well as accounting department, business school, and university administrators as they make decisions based on individual faculty member’s research productivity.

Keywords: Accounting Research Rankings, Accounting Research Methodology, Accounting Research Topical Areas

JEL Classification: M4, M40, M41, M42, M49
