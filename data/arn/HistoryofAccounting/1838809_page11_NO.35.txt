Abstract

This paper examines the two different methods of accounting for oil and gas. Full costs and successful efforts are the two methods someone in the extraction industry can utilize. This paper addresses the difference between full cost and successful efforts; why one method might be preferred over the other, and how different items are treated differently under each method. This paper also includes a brief history of both the methods. Full cost method of accounting allows the costs for exploration to be capitalized even if the well or field an unproved dry hole.
