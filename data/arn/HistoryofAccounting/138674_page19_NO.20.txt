Management Accounting in Europe: A View from Canada

Management Accounting Research, Vol 8, No 4, December 1998

Posted: 3 Nov 1998

Abstract

On the basis of a reading of Management Accounting: European Perspectives edited by Al Bhimani (1996), while there appears to be no historical pan-European perspective on management accounting earlier in this century groupings of countries -- Mediteranian, Western Europe, Scandinavian, and British -- did exhibit distinctive perspectives. However, following the advent of the relevance lost and strategic cost management movements, and especially activity-based costing, there does seem to be emerging a certain homogeneity in European management accounting practices. This commentary questions the intellectual and practical bases for these movements and activity-based costing. It also identifies some of the particular achievements of European management accounting researchers which are not covered in the book.

JEL Classification: M40, M46
