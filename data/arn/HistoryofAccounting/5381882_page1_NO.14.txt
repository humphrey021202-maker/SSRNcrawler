Abstract

This study proposes a new paradigm for preservation that integrates community-based participatory mapping (CBPM) with digital twin technologies. This approach integrates real-time monitoring, predictive analytics, and community participation to increase the resilience of heritage assets threatened by neglect, violence, and climate change. According to this research, Shibam's mud brick towers' structural robustness can be increased by 40% with the use of nano-silica reinforcement and real-time drone monitoring, opening the door to an nanotechnology hybrid paradigm for heritage preservation. Furthermore, this study highlights the significance of combining state-of-the-art technologies with traditional ways for sustainable conservation by examining worldwide case studies such as Aleppo and Timbuktu. The proposed approach ensures long-term preservation, enhances structural integrity, and encourages local ownership and involvement. This scalable strategy has crucial potential for heritage organizations worldwide, particularly in conflict zones, as it reduces restoration costs, increases community engagement, and integrates climate adaptive strategies. Since the study conforms with UNESCO's regulations and provides a comprehensive plan for conserving cultural heritage that faces extinction, it is a valuable resource for future preservation initiatives.
