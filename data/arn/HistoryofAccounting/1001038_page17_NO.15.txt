Abstract

This paper briefly discusses the history, benefits, and shortcomings of traditional audit field experiments to study market discrimination. Specifically it identifies template bias and experimenter bias as major concerns in the traditional audit method, and demonstrates through an empirical example that computerization of a resume or correspondence audit can greatly mitigate these concerns. Finally, it presents a useful meta-tool that future researchers can use to create their own resume audits.

Keywords: correspondence test, correspondence review, audit study, computerization, field experiment, labor market, discrimination, differential treatment
