Abstract

THIS CHAPTER EXAMINES the evolution of the New Zealand tax system from 1845 to 1876. The
key to this period is the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852 (UK), which was devised by the
Governor, Sir George Grey, and which divided the Colony into six provinces. There were
hardly any roads, so allowing isolated settler communities a degree of autonomy made
obvious sense. Grey’s more sinister aim, however, was to retain control of the purse strings
and thus dictate policy generally. In this he was markedly successful: the Act gave the
Governor tight control over the Colony’s two main sources of revenue (land sales and
customs duties) and also over the military (which he used to take Māori land by force). The
provinces were free to build and operate roads, wharves, railways, schools, hospitals and so
on – but they had to either persuade the Governor to supply funding or pay for them
themselves.

Twenty years later the difficulties of communication had been largely solved and the
Colonial Government, spectacularly insolvent prior to Grey’s arrival, was financially secure.
The provinces had served their purpose and in 1876 they were abolished. Since then, New
Zealand has had one of the most centralised systems of government and taxation in the
world, and the Māori people are still suffering from the catastrophic loss of their land.
