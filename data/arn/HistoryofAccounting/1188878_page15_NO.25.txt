Abstract

The objective of this report is to assist those undertaking an accounting oral history project for the first time by reporting on two recent oral history projects. While restricting discussion to the 'nuts and bolts' of undertaking recording oral history interviews, this is provided in sufficient detail, with reflection on past experiences, to benefit a researcher starting their first project.

Keywords: oral history, accounting

JEL Classification: N00, M41
