Taxation in the Bible

Oxford Encyclopedia of the Bible and Law, Forthcoming

NYU School of Law, Public Law Research Paper No. 12-65

12 Pages Posted: 20 Nov 2012

Date Written: November 20, 2012

Abstract

Given the range of biblical references, contested issues of sources and dating, and limited information about legal institutions and social practices, conclusions about taxation in the Bible must be drawn with caution. The available information, however, suggests that taxation was an important aspect of public administration in biblical Israel.
