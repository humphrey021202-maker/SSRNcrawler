Abstract

This paper examines the development and comparative strengths of accounting conceptual frameworks issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), tracing their evolution from early foundations to recent updates. It explores how these frameworks influence financial reporting objectives, qualitative characteristics, and measurement approaches, while revisiting key debates such as fair value versus historical cost, prudence versus neutrality, and global versus local relevance. The analysis extends to two emerging areas: sustainability reporting and digital assets. Sustainability disclosures have gained momentum following the ISSB's release of IFRS S1 and IFRS S2 in June 2023, which aim to establish a global foundation for investor-focused sustainability information. Meanwhile, accounting for digital assets continues to challenge recognition and measurement principles, with US GAAP adopting fair-value treatment for certain crypto assets (ASU 2023-08), while IFRS guidance remains anchored in IAS 38 and related decisions. The paper argues that both frameworks should adapt to better reflect sustainability-related information and provide clearer direction on digital assets, while maintaining core principles such as faithful representation and comparability. It concludes with implications for standard-setters, regulators, and researchers working to align financial reporting frameworks with changing economic conditions.
