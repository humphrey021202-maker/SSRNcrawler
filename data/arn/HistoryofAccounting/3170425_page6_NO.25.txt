Abstract

In this paper, the author documents the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ “special relationship” with the Financial Accounting Foundation and the Financial Accounting Standards Board, such that questions could be raised about whether these latter two bodies were truly independent of the Institute and of the practicing profession during the years from 1972 to 1980.

Keywords: Independence, Standard Setting, AICPA, FAF, FASB

JEL Classification: M41
