Abstract

This is a PowerPoint presentation that discusses the corporate governance failures behind major corporate scandals of the earlier 21st century. Initially, it details both Enron and Parmalat cases, considered the most emblematic and richer ones from the 2001-2003 period. For each one, I present the timeline, corporate governance failures, role of gatekeepers, and consequences for those involved. The presentation then lists a new crop of corporate governance problems in the 2007-2009 period, pointing out mains common factors associated with such scandals. It then concludes by questioning whether the lessons from previous governance scandals have indeed been learned by investors and regulators worldwide.

Keywords: Corporate Governance Cases, Corporate Failures, Enron, Parmalat, Lessons Learned
