Abstract

Until the 2000s, the biblical view of tax policy in the both the Christian and Jewish traditions was neutral to conservative in the political sense. The principal biblical tax principle is opposition to tax evasion. But in the last 10 years, academic commentary on tax policy and the Bible has shifted in a more politically progressive direction.

Keywords: the Bible, Susan Pace Hamill, Adam Chodorow, David Cay Johnston, Charles E. Curran, Pope Francis
