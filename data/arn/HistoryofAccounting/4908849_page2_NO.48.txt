Abstract

Different surveys conducted by the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), Asian Development Bank (ADB), and various other organisations have consistently estimated that the size of the black economy or shadow economy has experienced substantial growth in recent decades. This growth varies significantly across developing and least developed countries (LDCs). Furthermore, estimates from reputable sources such as the Financial Secrecy Index (FSI), Tax Justice Network, Oxfam, and other renowned agencies suggest that illicit financial flow is alarmingly immense, significantly affecting government tax revenue. The FSI, a significant indicator, demonstrates exceptionally high mean rankings for some developing LDCs. This crucial finding is viewed as one of the primary catalysts prompting governments to address this issue by considering developing innovative solutions. These include the exploration of cryptocurrencies, the implementation of blockchain applications, the utilisation of artificial intelligence to enhance e-governance, the establishment of e-cryptocurrency as legal tender, the widespread adoption of e-commerce, and the gradual phasing out of traditional paper money in favour of digitised alternatives. Regrettably, the lack of official figures about this matter can be attributed to the distinctive characteristics of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and blockchain applications, primarily in countries with limited technological advancements. As a result, the current study aims to shed light on a concept known as the FDI return index, focusing specifically on selected developing and LDC countries. By exploring this index, a comprehensive understanding of these countries' economic performance and potential foreign direct investment returns can be obtained.

Foreign direct investment is now widely acknowledged as being at the forefront when providing substantial financial resources for countries to effectively address their macroeconomic development requirements on both domestic and international fronts. This is particularly true for developing nations and those classified as least developed countries, where the dire need for economic upliftment is paramount. Moreover, the profound impact of foreign direct investment extends far beyond mere economic implications, as it serves as an influential catalyst for driving the creation of communal prosperity, promoting sustainable development, generating a multitude of employment opportunities, and bridging the divide between imports and exports, production and consumption, and various other socioeconomic factors. Consequently, it should come as no surprise that attracting high levels of investment capital has remained the primary goal for host nations throughout countless eras of history, as it has proven to be crucial for achieving sustained economic growth, fostering technological advancements, enhancing infrastructure and public services, improving healthcare and education systems, and ultimately uplifting the overall quality of life for its citizens. By attracting foreign direct investment, nations can tap into external resources, knowledge, and expertise that can significantly boost their domestic industries, encourage innovation and entrepreneurship, and drive productivity and competitiveness in the global market.
