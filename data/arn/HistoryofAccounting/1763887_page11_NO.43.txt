Abstract

The year 2002 marks the 50th anniversary of the publication of the first issue of the Canadian Tax Journal. It therefore seems appropriate to commemorate this anniversary in some way - to celebrate the accomplishments of the journal and to renew the commitment of the journal to members of the Canadian Tax Foundation and the broader Canadian tax community.

Keywords: Tax, Canada, Canadian Tax Journal

JEL Classification: K39
