The purpose of this project is to analyze goodwill trends in companies after FASB 142 was released in 2001. Data was collected and analyzed from financial statements and organizational web sites. This project examined the systematic response to the new goodwill impairment regulations, and concludes that the FASB regulations were effective in requiring company financial reports to become more transparent and accurate.
