Abstract

Global markets seem to be increasingly integrated but there is no well-accepted measure of integration. We show that the correlation across markets is a poor measure; perfectly integrated markets can exhibit weak correlation. We derive a new integration measure based on the explanatory power of a multi-factor model and use it empirically to investigate recent trends in global integration. For most countries, there has been a marked increase in measured integration over the past three decades, but this is not indicated by correlations among country indexes. Published by Elsevier B.V. $ We are grateful for constructive comments from two referees, Rajna Gibson, John Griffin, Astrid Schornick, and participants at the 2009 American Finance Association meetings in San Francisco.

Keywords: global, integration, market
