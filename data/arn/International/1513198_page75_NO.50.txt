Abstract

This research paper elaborates the treatment of participation rights issued by corporations under German tax law and accounting regulations. In particular the study points out differences with regard to equity-equivalent and debt-equivalent participation rights under both regimes. Based on a mathematical-quantitative approach the paper analyses the varying tax burden triggered by differences in legal status and levels of ownership. It also calculates the best investment strategy for each investor. Furthermore the paper examines the contradictory interpretation of German tax and accounting regulations which allows the disclosure of certain participation rights as equity for accounting purposes, while treated as debt for tax purposes simultaneously. It also gives a brief outlook on difficulties in the interpretation of participations rights under cross-border aspects in the German-Swiss DTT. Finally it identifies the implications of the different investment opportunities and recommends participation rights as a useful financial instrument in the aftermath of BASEL II regulations.
