Abstract

Major tax reforms in the 1980s saw movement towards to tax systems that are relatively pure, in that they are not given additional tasks promoting economic or social policies. The USA under the Clinton Administration began to show signs of reversing some of the changes of the 1980s. Tax policy in Europe is fixed firmly on neutrality. In Asia it is quite different and all sorts of incentives are used but there are signs that the merits of these incentives are beginning to be questioned.

Keywords: International tax law, Business law, Tax reform, Tax simplification, Capital – revenue distinction, Tax preferences, incentives

JEL Classification: K33, K34
