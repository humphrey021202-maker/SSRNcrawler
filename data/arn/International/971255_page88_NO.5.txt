Abstract

I examine the short- and long-term impact of the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) on cross-listed foreign private issuers. Both short- and long-term test results suggest that the costs of SOX compliance significantly exceed its benefits and reduce the net benefits of cross-listings.

Keywords: Sarbanes-Oxley, Foreign private issuer, Deregistration, Corporate governance, Law and finance, Cross-listing, ADR

JEL Classification: G15, G18, G38, M41, M47
