Abstract

I derive a novel production-based asset pricing result that relates exchange rates to the intertemporal marginal rates of transformation of capital (i.e., returns on investment) within multinational firms with headquarters at home and foreign affiliates abroad. This q-theory of multinationals is analogous to a standard international consumption-based model, but uses multinational producers and production functions rather than consumers and stochastic discount factors. Its structural estimation infers exchange rates from US multinational aggregates on real investment, output, and capital stocks. Tested across 44 countries since the 1980s, it successfully prices cross-sectional carry trade spreads through the fundamentals of US foreign affiliates.
