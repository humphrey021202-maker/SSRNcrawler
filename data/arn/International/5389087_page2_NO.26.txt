Abstract

We leverage the rollout of China’s National Park System reform as a quasi-natural experiment to examine how regional biodiversity conservation efforts influence corporate financial reporting. Using a staggered difference-in-differences design, we find that treated firms engage in significantly greater downward real earnings management following policy implementation. Mechanism analysis reveals that mounting government attention and public sentiment elevate firms’ perceived political costs, prompting income suppression to reduce visibility and mitigate regulatory or redistributive risk. These effects are more pronounced among firms with higher public visibility and those located in biodiversity-rich regions. Additional analysis suggests that the observed earnings management is primarily driven by production-based REM, with limited reliance on accrual-based methods. Our findings highlight the unintended microeconomic consequences of ecological governance reforms.

Keywords: Biodiversity Transition, Real Earnings Management, Political Cost
