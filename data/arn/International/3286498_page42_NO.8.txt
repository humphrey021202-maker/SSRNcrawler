Abstract

This paper investigates the adoption of hedge accounting by Malaysian listed companies in reporting their use of derivatives for hedging activities. Based on a sample of 300 Malaysian listed companies, we found that only 162 companies (54 percent) used derivatives to hedge their financial risks exposure and only 30 percent of the companies chose to apply hedge accounting. In addition, this study examines the relationship between the company specific characteristics and their application of hedge accounting. The logistic regression results showed that the decision to apply hedge accounting by Malaysian companies is positively influenced by the company size and leverage. The implications of the findings were discussed.
