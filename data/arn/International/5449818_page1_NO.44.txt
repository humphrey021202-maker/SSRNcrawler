Abstract

This study revisits the Information Systems (IS) Success Model by incorporating sociocultural dimensions to explain the effectiveness of Management Accounting Information Systems (MAIS) in a developing economy context. While prior research has acknowledged the role of organizational Culture and user attributes in shaping IS outcomes, few studies have empirically tested these dynamics in culturally distinct and resource-constrained environments. Drawing on a socio-technical framework, this paper investigates how organizational Culture, user competency, and top management support influence information quality, system use, and ultimately, decision-making support. Using data from 360 managerial-level respondents across diverse Indonesian industries, the model was tested via Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). The findings indicate that organizational Culture significantly enhances both information quality and system use; however, information quality consistently exerts a positive impact on decision-making support. Contrary to conventional assumptions, system use alone—when measured by frequency—shows an adverse direct effect, raising concerns about superficial engagement with MAIS. Mediation analysis further reveals that the impact of organizational Culture is primarily indirect, operating through improvements in information relevance and user competence. The study contributes theoretically by extending the IS Success Model to account for culturally embedded organizational dynamics, highlighting the need for richer behavioral constructs in AIS research. Practically, the results suggest that organizations should prioritize the quality of information flows and user readiness over simplistic metrics of system utilization, especially in emerging economies where cultural variables substantially shape IS adoption and usage outcomes.

Keywords: organizational culture, Accounting information systems, Decision support, Information quality, System use, User competency
