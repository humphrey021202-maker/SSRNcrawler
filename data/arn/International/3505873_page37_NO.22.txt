ABN AMRO’s Impact Statements – A Case Study on Making Societal Value Visible

20 Pages Posted: 9 Jan 2020

Abstract

Many companies talk about their social and environmental contributions, but very few make them visible. This is typically attributed to lack of methods and data. But ABN AMRO has taken the bold step to produce insightful impact statements, including an Integrated P&L, which show that it can be done. This case study analyses how ABN AMRO got to produce its Impact Report, what is in there, and what its impact could be. The main obstacles seem to be mindsets rather than data and methods.

Keywords: integrated reporting, impact, sustainability, sustainable finance
