Abstract

The 2003 Italian Corporate Reform Law, establishing one-tier vs two-tier board for listed and unlisted joint stock companies, introduced an alternative corporate governance system. We compare 548 unlisted firms: corporations with best performance in sales and capital structure, as well as those under “control and coordination”, maintain a traditional system. Conversely, firms with a high proportion of individual shareholders adopt alternative systems. For alternative systems' firms, split between one-tier and two-tier boards, companies under “control and coordination” action tend to implement a one-tier system, same as firms with a higher proportion of individual shareholders.

Keywords: Corporate governance, one-tier board, two-tier board

JEL Classification: G34, K22, M42
