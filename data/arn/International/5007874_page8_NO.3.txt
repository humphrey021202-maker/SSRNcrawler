Abstract

The protection of refugees and the promotion of human rights are critical challenges facing the international community today. This paper explores the complementary roles of Islamic law and modern international law in addressing these issues. Islamic law, rooted in principles of justice, compassion, and humanitarianism, provides a moral and ethical framework for the treatment of refugees. It emphasizes the obligation of Muslim communities to offer sanctuary and support to those in need, reflecting core values of humanity and dignity. On the other hand, modern international law, encapsulated in instruments such as the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol, establishes the legal obligations of states towards refugees, outlining their rights and the responsibilities of host nations. These international frameworks aim to ensure the safety and dignity of refugees while promoting their integration into host societies. This paper argues that the synergy between Islamic law and international law can enhance refugee protection mechanisms. By aligning Islamic legal principles with international standards, a more robust and holistic approach to refugee rights can be developed. The discussion will highlight the areas of convergence between the two legal systems, such as the emphasis on human dignity, nonrefoulement, and the right to seek asylum. Furthermore, the potential challenges and limitations in harmonizing these legal frameworks will be examined, emphasizing the need for dialogue and collaboration among legal scholars, practitioners, and policymakers. In conclusion, this paper aims to contribute to the discourse on refugee protection by showcasing how Islamic law and modern international law can work together to create a more comprehensive and effective system that upholds the rights and dignity of refugees worldwide.

Keywords: Islamic law, international law, refugee protection, human rights, asylum, nonrefoulement, humanitarian principles, legal frameworks, integration, dignity
