Abstract

When do accounting standards influence corporate policies under international convergence regime? This study examines whether international standards affect local GAAP firms even before formal convergence, focusing on Japan, where standard setters have declared a substantive convergence to IFRS. Inspired by Ma and Thomas (2023), I analyze IFRS 16’s impact on leasing decisions among Japanese local GAAP firms. Surprisingly, similar effects emerge: highly exposed firms reduced operating leases and shifted lease-to-buy decisions post IFRS 16 issuance. These findings show that the issuance of IFRS can preemptively influence local GAAP firms, highlighting the global impact of international standards before formal convergence.
