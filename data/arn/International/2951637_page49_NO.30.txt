Abstract

I present a summary and analysis of a series of papers from this special issue of Accounting in Europe that examine the role and current status of IFRS in the completion of National Accounting Rules applicable to large ‘non‐listed in a regulated market’ non‐financial undertakings trading for gain in 25 European countries following the recent implementation of the new European Accounting Directive 2013/34/EU. IFRS has had a varying degree of influence across European countries. Some refer and are closely aligned to IFRS or to IFRS for SMEs, some while influenced by IFRS retain complete independence and some show limited influence mostly when accounts are for other purposes such as taxation, dividend distribution or creditor protection. I present a number of classification schemes and contrast these with Nobes (2008) two group accounting classification of European accounting systems as strong equity/commercially driven versus weak equity/government driven/tax‐dominated systems.

Keywords: IFRS, Europe, Accounting Directive 2013/34/EU, SMEs, Classification

JEL Classification: M41, M48, F36, H87, K22, L50
