Abstract

This study examines the impact of the Financial Reporting Standard No. 44 New Zealand Additional Disclosures (FRS 44) amendment issued by the New Zealand Accounting Standards Board (NZASB). The FRS 44 amendment aligned disclosure requirements for managerial assessments of going concern risk in financial reports with auditing standards for periods ending on or after 30 September 2020. We first present descriptive evidence on the frequency of going concern opinions (GCO), frequency of going concern issues identified as key audit matters (GCKAM), and frequency and content of managerial assessments of going concern risk (GCMA) before and after the FRS 44 amendment. Second, we show lower audit fees and shorter audit lags for financially distressed companies post-FRS 44 implementation. This suggests that the harmonization of accounting and auditing disclosure requirements alleviates tension during the going concern decision-making process for affected companies, subsequently leading to reduced audit fees.

Keywords: Going Concern, Management Disclosure, Managerial Assessment, Key Audit Matters

JEL Classification: G38, M42, M48
