Abstract

This study examines the influence of Key Audit Matter (KAM) characteristics on corporate capital structure decisions. The methodology focuses on non-financial Australian firms, with data collected from their financial reports. The analysis was conducted using two models: the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) and Driscoll-Kraay standard errors regression, employed as a robustness check against cross-sectional errors. The results indicate that KAM Tone exerts a statistically significant positive effect on capital structure, whereas KAM Specifying (measured by the number of words per KAM) has a statistically significant negative effect. The Number of KAMs shows an insignificant negative effect, while IT-related KAM disclosures exhibit an insignificant positive effect. These findings are consistent with the study’s theoretical framework, which incorporates Signaling Theory, Resource-Based View, Agency Theory, and Prospect Theory, confirming that KAM characteristics serve as signals of financial quality, influence stakeholders’ evaluations, and affect capital structure decisions. The study provides practical evidence on the role of external financial disclosure in shaping capital structure and performance, supporting the theoretical framework and informing more strategic financial decision-making.

Keywords: Key Audit Matters, Audit Narrative Disclosure, IT-related Audit Disclosure, Specifying in Audit Reports
