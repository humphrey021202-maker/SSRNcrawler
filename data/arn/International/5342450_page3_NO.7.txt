Abstract

Sustainability initiatives are becoming core components of strategic business planning, especially in the Middle East where national visions such as Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 and the UAE's Net Zero 2050 Strategy have made Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) investments central to growth. However, the accounting treatment of such initiatives; whether they qualify as capital expenditure (CAPEX) or operational expenditure (OPEX); remains a subject of ongoing debate. This paper explores the IFRS guidance and provides a practical framework for classifying sustainability-related spending. It draws attention to the implications on financial statements, investor perception, and regulatory reporting, contextualized for the Middle East region.

Keywords: IFRS, Sustainability Accounting, Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG), ESG Reporting, Environmental Accounting, Capitalization of ESG Expenditure, Carbon Accounting
