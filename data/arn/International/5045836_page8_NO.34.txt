Abstract

The adoption of IFRS 16 has impacted accounting information, potentially influencing decision-making processes. Using a unique setting of a highly leasing-dependent economy, we examine the impact of IFRS 16 adoption on decision usefulness for sophisticated users. The sample comprises 1,099 firm-year observations related to companies listed on the Brazilian Stock Market (B3), with data from Refinitiv® spanning the 2015-2022 period. First, we find an increase in transparency regarding leasing contracts following the regulation change. Moreover, using Diff-in-Diff models, we provide robust evidence of no significant difference in earnings forecast errors after the adoption. Overall, the results support our hypothesis that sophisticated users follow detailed information on lease contracts through other channels, even before IFRS 16 became effective.

Keywords: Informed Investors, IFRS 16, Analyst Forecast, Leases.
