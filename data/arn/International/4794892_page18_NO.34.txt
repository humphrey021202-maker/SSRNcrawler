Abstract

I examine whether country-level loss aversion influences stock price sensitivity to negative earnings news vis-à-vis positive earnings news. Using two recently developed country-level measures of loss aversion, I find that the stock price sensitivity to bad earnings news is higher in high loss-aversion countries than in low loss aversion countries. In contrast, the stock price sensitivity to good earnings news is generally unassociated with loss aversion. Thus, there is an intuitive asymmetry in how loss aversion impacts the market response to negative news relative to positive news. Consistent with the earnings announcement returns, further analysis reveals that a subsequent return drift to extreme bad news (i.e., PEAD) is present among low loss-aversion countries but not high loss-aversion countries, suggesting that loss averse investors more fully incorporate bad earnings news into stock prices. In contrast, the return drift to extreme positive news is detectable regardless of the level of loss aversion. Additional analysis also suggests that the influence of loss aversion on the market response to earnings news does not reflect differences in the informativeness of earnings news for future net income and cash flow performance. This influence of loss aversion is also more pronounced in countries with a short-term orientation, which should exacerbate loss aversion, and in countries that Hofstede (2001) characterizes as more restrained. In these countries, investors should be less accustomed to corporate risk-taking.

Keywords: loss aversion, unexpected earnings, earnings response coefficient (ERC), financial reporting
