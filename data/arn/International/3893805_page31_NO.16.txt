Abstract

Fair value’ accounting is often taken for granted. Regulators and standard setters argue that fair value norms must be implemented due to market imperatives (Bhimani 2008; Young 2003, 2006; Young and Williams 2010). Several papers argue in its defence, and others against it, without discussing its origins and societal pathways. In many countries around the world, practitioners must follow fair value practices in accordance to regulations and standards issued by the IASB and FASB. However, although the historical origins of fair value should have been settled by now, they have not been settled yet.

Keywords: Fair value accounting
