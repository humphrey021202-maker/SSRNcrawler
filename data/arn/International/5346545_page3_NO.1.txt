Abstract

This study investigates the transformative impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on corporate tax compliance and financial reporting processes. Using a mixed-methods approach, the research explores how AI technologies—such as machine learning, natural language processing, and predictive analytics—enhance accuracy, efficiency, and regulatory alignment in tax functions. Through case analysis, statistical data, and implementation frameworks, the study identifies key success factors, challenges, and future trends in AI adoption. Findings indicate that organizations leveraging AI experience significant improvements in data quality, error detection, and real-time compliance capabilities. The research also highlights the importance of governance, ethical AI practices, and cross-functional collaboration. A phased model for AI implementation is proposed, supported by visual data and practical recommendations for corporate entities, regulators, and technology providers. This paper contributes to the growing literature on digital transformation in finance and offers strategic insights for navigating the evolving tax technology landscape.
