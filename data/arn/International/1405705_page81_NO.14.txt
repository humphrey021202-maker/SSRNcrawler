Abstract

This study is the first to examine whether systematic liquidity risk is priced on the London Stock Exchange (LSE). We use the proportional quoted bid-ask spread, Amihud’s (2002) market illiquidity ratio, and turnover rate as liquidity proxies. In contrast to US studies, we do not find evidence that systematic liquidity risk is priced on the LSE.

Keywords: LSE, liquidity, systematic risk, asset pricing

JEL Classification: G1
