Abstract

Thailand is capitalizing on its popularity as a tourist destination. Recent amendments to Immigration regulations now allow foreign nationals to stay and work in Thailand on a long-term basis, subject to certain requirements. However, despite this easing of restrictions, due consideration must be given to the tax implications that may arise, and these are discussed in the article.
