Abstract

We examine the effect of business group affiliation on firm level investment efficiency using a large international sample. Prior research on business groups has investigated both the benefits (value-adding perspective) and drawbacks (value-destroying perspective) of this form of ownership structure. We first document that group affiliated firms are more efficient in their investment decisions than stand-alone firms, supporting the value-adding perspective. Further, this effect arises because the former is better than the latter in constraining both over-investment and under-investment. Moreover, this internal capital allocation matters more in countries with high external financing restrictions. Analysis at the business group level reveals that this relation is more pronounced for member firms in a pyramidal structure group and located in the lower layer.
