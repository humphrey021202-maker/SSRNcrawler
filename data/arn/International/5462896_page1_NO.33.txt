Abstract

This study examines whether large language models exhibit systematic country bias in financial fraud detection. Analyzing 30,000 synthetic transactions with identical statistical properties across three country attributions (United States, Great Britain, and China), we find LLMs assign significantly higher fraud probabilities to Chinese-attributed transactions (36.2%) compared to Western countries (≈30-31%), resulting in accuracy disparities of 67% versus 74%. The gap remains stable across five independent experimental replications and persists when using Chinese language prompts, ruling out linguistic effects. Bias mitigation strategies, such as requiring explanations or explicit country neutrality instructions, reduce but fail to eliminate these disparities. Testing across alternative models (Llama, DeepSeek) confirms the persistence of country bias across different LLMs. These results provide critical evidence that an LLM's latent stereotypes can override objective data, highlighting the need for systematic auditing to ensure both equitable and factually grounded outcomes in cross-border AI applications.

Keywords: Large Language Models, Country Bias, Algorithmic Fairness, Fraud Detection
