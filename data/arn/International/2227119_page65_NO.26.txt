Abstract

Based on a sample of Italian firms, this paper investigates whether separate financial statements are useful to capital market investors and whether IFRS are more value-relevant than domestic GAAP. This issue is key in evaluating the decision made by some states in the European Union to extend the use of IFRS to separate financial statements.

Findings provide evidence that separate financial statements are value-relevant, regardless of the accounting standard set. However, contrary to expectations, separate financial statements under IFRS do not have incremental information content beyond domestic GAAP. There is even some evidence that domestic GAAP are more value-relevant than IFRS.

Finally, this paper documents the important role of model specification in value-relevance studies.

Keywords: Value-Relevance, Domestic GAAP, IFRS, Separate Financial Statements, Regulation 1606/2002

JEL Classification: M41, G10
