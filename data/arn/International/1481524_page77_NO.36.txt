Abstract

This paper is a submission to the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) on proposed Draft Income Tax Statement EB/2009/02. This submission analyzes the effect of the proposed treatment of tax uncertainties, which create potential contraventions of constitutions world-wide if implemented in its suggested form. The proposed provisions are more detailed and extensive than those of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48) ("Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes") in the U.S.A.

Keywords: FIN 48, IASB, International Accounting Standards Board, FASB, Financial Accounting Standards Board, EB/2009/02, Income Tax Statement, tax uncertainties
