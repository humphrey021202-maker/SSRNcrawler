Abstract

This study investigates and compares biotech pharmaceutical business models among China, Japan and the U.S. It finds significant differences among the three countries in i) R&D innovation, ii) market penetration, and iii) human capital extraction. As a result, firms in these countries demonstrate different competitive advantages in global drug markets. Moreover, these differences also raise accounting concerns.
