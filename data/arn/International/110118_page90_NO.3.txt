Management Accounting Practices in Europe: A Perspective from the States

Posted: 25 Aug 1998

Michael D. Shields

Michigan State University - Department of Accounting & Information Systems

Abstract

I provide a perspective on four questions based on Management Accounting: European Perspectives edited by Al Bhimani (1996). First, seven factors are identified as having shaped management accounting practice in European nations - academics, education, government, professional associations, consultants, technology, and inter-nation transfer of information. Second, evidence supports the view that substantive change in management accounting techniques in European nations is occurring, but on a limited basis (e.g., adopting ABC for some products). Third, evidence indicates that convergence is occurring across European nations in the presence of management accounting techniques, but not necessarily in how those techniques are used. Fourth, management accounting practice in European nations, particularly the presence of techniques, is converging on a global management accounting practice model. I propose that management accounting practice (particularly the presence of techniques) is converging across nations (at least for those firms that are affected by the global economy) and diverging across industries both within and between nations.
