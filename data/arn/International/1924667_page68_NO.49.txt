Abstract

This study contributes to the current debate on IFRS adoption by considering the economic consequences of IFRS adoption as indicated by impact on the cost of equity capital. Using a sample of 354 firm-year observations on New Zealand listed companies over the period 1998-2009, we find that there is a significant negative association between IFRS adoption and cost of capital. This result is robust to several variations in sample composition and model specification. To the extent that higher quality accounting standards reduce the cost of equity capital, the result suggests that IFRS is a higher quality set of accounting standards than pre IFRS New Zealand GAAP.

Keywords: Cost of equity capital, IFRS adoption, Economic consequences

JEL Classification: G15, K22, M41, M48
