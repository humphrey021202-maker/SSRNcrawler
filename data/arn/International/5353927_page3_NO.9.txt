Abstract

This study examines the impact of Chief Financial Officers' (CFOs) integrity on corporate earnings management within Chinese listed firms. We construct a novel, exogenous proxy for CFO integrity based on the academic ethical climate of their undergraduate institutions, measured via a University Plagiarism Index derived from faculty publication data. Using a large panel of Chinese A-share firms from 2011 to 2019, we find that firms led by CFOs from universities with higher academic integrity exhibit significantly lower levels of earnings management, particularly upward earnings manipulation. The effect is more pronounced in privately-owned firms, firms with limited analyst coverage, and regions with higher marketization but weaker institutional enforcement. Our findings highlight CFO integrity as an important informal governance mechanism that substitutes for external monitoring in emerging markets. This study contributes to the literature on managerial ethics, informal governance, and financial reporting quality by introducing a scalable integrity proxy with exogenous identification.

Keywords: CFO integrity, Earnigns management, Informal governance mechanism, Earnings quality, China
