Abstract

This study examines the consistency of IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements with the property rights theory (PRT). Our findings are fourfold. First, with respect to a basis for consolidation, IFRS 10 is consistent with PRT in that it regards both power over—and claims to the returns from—the subsidiary as requirements for consolidation. However, the meanings of power and returns in IFRS 10 are not necessarily the same as those in PRT. Second, PRT and IFRS 10 hold different views on the object over which the parent’s power is exercised: the former focuses on the subsidiary assets, the latter, on the subsidiary’s relevant activities. Third, the accounting treatments of a non-controlling interest (NCI) in IFRS 10 are largely consistent with PRT. Last, regarding SPEs that may differ from subsidiaries as their activities are strictly determined by contracts, it is not clear from PRT how such characteristics should be reflected in their accounting treatments.

Keywords: Consolidation accounting, IFRS 10, Faithful representation, Incomplete contract, Property rights theory
