Abstract

This study examines how the transition from voluntary to mandatory One Report regulation affects corporate reporting quality in Thailand, analyzing 232 annual reports from 58 SET50 companies (2019-2022). Using a cluster-based approach and leveraging the Integrated Reporting (IR) framework as an analytical lens, the research evaluates reporting quality across multiple dimensions including capitals, guiding principles, and content elements. Findings show significant improvement in reporting quality post-regulation implementation, with companies advancing from moderate to high disclosure levels. Two distinct patterns emerged: Cluster 1 demonstrated comprehensive integration of IR components with strong value creation linkages across framework components, while Cluster 2 showed limited depth in intellectual, human, and natural capital disclosures. Environmentally sensitive industries exhibited consistently superior reporting quality. This first empirical investigation of mandatory One Report implementation in an emerging market context provides crucial insights for policymakers and practitioners in developing corporate reporting practices, while offering a novel assessment framework for evaluating reporting quality transitions.

Keywords: One Report, Mandatory Disclosure, Reporting Quality, Thailand, Cluster Analysis
