Abstract

Legislation regulating tax preparers has seen little attention in New Zealand, but this is not the case in Australia and the USA. In Australia is obligatory for those who professionally prepare tax returns to be registered as tax agents. In both countries – the USA and Australia – tax preparers can be held liable for preparing incorrect tax returns.

Keywords: International tax law, Business law, Tax return preparation, Tax preparers

JEL Classification: K33, K34
