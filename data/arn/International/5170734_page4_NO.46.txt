Abstract

This research paper explores the critical role of business intelligence (BI) in enabling U.S. companies to achieve transparent and responsible artificial intelligence (AI). The study aims to assess how BI can support ethical AI development by ensuring fairness, transparency, and accountability in AI systems. A qualitative research methodology was employed, involving a comprehensive literature review, case study analysis, and expert interviews to evaluate the integration of BI tools in AI governance. The findings indicate that BI enhances ethical decision-making by providing data-driven insights that help identify and mitigate biases, improve algorithmic fairness, and ensure regulatory compliance. Additionally, BI enables organizations to establish robust governance frameworks, fostering greater public trust and competitive advantage. The study concludes that integrating BI with AI ethics is essential for developing trustworthy AI systems that align with societal values and regulatory expectations. Future research should explore the development of standardized frameworks, methodologies for evaluating AI fairness, and the role of regulatory bodies in promoting responsible AI adoption.

Keywords: Business Intelligence, Artificial Intelligence, AI Ethics, Transparency, Responsible AI, Algorithmic Fairness, Competitive Advantage
