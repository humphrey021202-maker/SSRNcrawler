Abstract

The idea of shareholder-value based management (VBM) has become widely accepted among German corporations, resulting in an increased need to provide value-relevant information to the market. This paper presents a general framework of Value Reporting, which is derived from basic valuation concepts, to give guidance to the contents and structure of the presenta-tion of value-relevant information. A value-driver model is derived, which links valuation components and information necessary for their derivation. This framework is then applied to the current disclosure practice of the German DAX100 companies. The study shows great differences in the quality of information. Overall only about 25% of the desirable information was disclosed.

Keywords: Analysis, Business Reporting, Valuation

JEL Classification: G14, M41
