Abstract

This paper identifies twelve procedures deemed challenging to the auditors in the insurance sector. Semi structured interviews with the technical partners of two Big Four firms based in Texas reveal that the US auditors use the Practice Note 20 (The audit of insurers in the United Kingdom) issued by the Auditing Practices Board (UK) as a basis to conduct the audits. Due to complexity, the auditors need to be diligent while discharging their duties of care. Results have implications to the public policy authorities, stakeholders and audit profession.

Keywords: governance, insurance, audit, audit standards and practice note

JEL Classification: M49, M47, G38, G34, G22
