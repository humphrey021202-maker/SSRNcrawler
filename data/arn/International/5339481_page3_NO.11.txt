Abstract

The exchange rate system is a fundamental component of a country's macroeconomic policy. The two main regimes commonly used in various countries are the fixed exchange rate system and the floating exchange rate system. Both have their own characteristics, advantages, and limitations in responding to global economic dynamics, especially when facing external shocks such as the global financial crisis, commodity price fluctuations, and changes in monetary policy in developed countries. This study aims to analyze and compare the effectiveness of both systems in maintaining macroeconomic stability during periods of crisis and external pressures. This study uses a quantitative approach based on panel data from developing and developed countries during the period 1995 to 2025, considering key macroeconomic variables such as economic growth, inflation rate, exchange rate, and foreign exchange reserves. The results of the analysis show that a fixed exchange rate system tends to provide price stability and strengthen investor confidence, but often causes pressure on foreign exchange reserves and limitations on domestic monetary policy. In contrast, a floating exchange rate system offers flexibility in adjusting to external shocks, but risks causing short-term exchange rate volatility and inflation. Th.us, there is no single system that is optimal for all countries; the choice of an appropriate exchange rate system depends heavily on the structural conditions of the economy, the capacity of monetary institutions, and the degree of openness and integration of a country's economy to global markets.

Keywords: Fixed exchange rate, floating exchange rate, external shocks, macroeconomic stability, financial crisis, monetary flexibility
