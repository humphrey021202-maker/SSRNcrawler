Abstract

Student enrollment decline has become a concern for accounting academies and the profession, with students often perceiving accounting as boring. As gaming becomes an integral part of students' lifestyle, this study explores the potential of Digital Role-Playing Games (D-RPGs) in accounting education as a scalable gamification method which is easy for online delivery and duplication, requiring fewer educational resources compared to traditional accounting games. The authors propose a framework for integrating D-RPGs into accounting education. Through a field study involving a D-RPG with 116 students, our findings reveal that D-RPGs significantly enhance perceived learning. While the game's reward system and role-playing elements foster flow experience, the role-playing elements additionally strengthen learning motivation. These findings demonstrate that D-RPGs can effectively engage college students in accounting education. Our research contributes insights for future metaverse education through storytelling and interaction elements and provides guidance for educators seeking innovative teaching strategies to attract students.
