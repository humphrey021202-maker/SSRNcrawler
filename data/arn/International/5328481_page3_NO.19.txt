Abstract

The accounting profession, traditionally characterized by systematic procedures and adherence to regulations, is seeing a transformative change propelled by Artificial Intelligence (AI). This conceptual research study integrates existing literature and industry experience to deliver a thorough overview of AI's diverse effects on the company accounting function. We contend that AI transcends the automation of routine tasks and fundamentally transforms essential activitiestransaction processing, financial reporting, auditing, and strategic analysis-through technologies such as machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), robotic process automation (RPA), and predictive analytics. Based on Institutional Theory and Task-Technology Fit, the analysis highlights critical effects: improved efficiency and accuracy, the transformation of the accountant's role into strategic advisory, notable changes in necessary skillsets, and new challenges concerning data, ethics, security, and implementation. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for comprehending this shift, highlighting that the genuine benefit of AI is in enhancing human expertise, thereby allowing the accounting function to evolve into a proactive, predictive, and strategic collaborator. We assert that effective navigation necessitates proactive adaptation by professionals, educators, and company leaders, delineating the framework and competencies that will characterize the future accounting department. Considerable obstacles persist; nonetheless, the opportunity for improved financial acumen and organizational flexibility is considerable.
