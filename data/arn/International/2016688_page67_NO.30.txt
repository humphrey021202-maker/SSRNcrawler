Abstract

This paper aims at analysing the value relevance of accounting information prepared following IFRS in United States, compared to value relevance in the “domestic” market. Since a large number of studies addresses the question of confronting IFRS, U.S. GAAP and other domestic accounting standards, but there are no evidence of how much a foreign market evaluates IFRS, this paper tries to fill this gap.

By analysing the value relevance of European cross listed companies in the U.S., which prepare their annual reports following IFRS, I find that the variability of the stock prices at New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) are better explained than European (in particular, German and Italian) stock prices, by the same accounting data.

Furthermore, I find a lower value relevance of annual report prepared under U.S. GAAP than IFRS, at NYSE.

Keywords: IFRS, U.S. GAAP, cross listed, value relevance

JEL Classification: M41
