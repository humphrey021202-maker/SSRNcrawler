Abstract

This paper examines whether and how firms adjust their voluntary disclosure in response to changes in peer disclosure behavior. Using the 2007 elimination of the IFRS-U.S. GAAP reconciliation requirement for Foreign Private Issuers (FPIs) as a shock to the peer information environment of U.S. firms, we document a positive peer effect. We first show that FPIs significantly increase their voluntary disclosures to compensate for the lost mandatory information, resulting in improved information environments. We then use this variation in peer firm voluntary disclosures to assess changes in the disclosure behavior among U.S. firms. We find that U.S. firms with affected FPI peers increase their own disclosure. These peer effects are stronger among U.S. firms in competitive industries, but weaker when peer firms share analysts consistent with a substitution effect. U.S. peer firm disclosures attract significant higher investor attention, yet these disclosures are less informative-more vague, more complex, and less quantitative-and are associated with increased information asymmetry. These findings suggest that peer effects in disclosure are economically meaningful but can reflect strategic signaling rather than a commitment to transparency.

Keywords: Voluntary Disclosure, Mandatory Disclosure, Peer Effects, Substitution Effect, Strategic Disclosure
