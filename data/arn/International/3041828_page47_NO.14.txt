Abstract

This paper thus seeks to shed some light on the tools and techniques available for testing hedge effectiveness under relevant accounting standards in order to aid organizations in properly recording and disclosing their derivatives transactions. It is important to point out that this paper will focus mainly on hedge effectiveness testing methodologies and will not address the entire process of recording derivative transactions from start to finish. Nonetheless, the topics covered will form a strong building block for those interested in further exploring the nuances of derivatives accounting.

Keywords: Derivatives, Hedge Accounting, FAS 133, Swaps
