Abstract

We argue and document that persistent institutional factors determine managerial accounting policy practice under IFRS. In an analysis of accounting choice across thirteen European countries, we study both overt and covert choices, aggregating them to measure their impact over income, thereby focusing on firm overall accounting strategy and not only on individual choices. Our results indicate that institutional factors significantly explain the observed heterogeneity in accounting policy practices and that firm characteristics have a smaller role in explaining them. Capital market structure and tax-alignment are particularly important factor in driving accounting practice. Contrary to the recent emphasis on enforcement as a key institutional factor, our evidence indicates it is a second order factor, when controlling for other institutional factors.

Keywords: Accounting policy practices, International differences, IFRS, institutional factors, managerial reporting incentives

JEL Classification: M41, M44, M47
