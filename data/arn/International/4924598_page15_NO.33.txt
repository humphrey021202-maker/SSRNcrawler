Abstract

We investigate the effects of enforcement of mandatory CSR reporting on CSR reports and on economic outcomes. Drawing from a survey among enforcement authorities in the European Union (EU), we identify and empirically exploit the initiation in 2021 of enforcement procedures for CSR reports in Sweden. Using difference-in-differences analyses with matched Danish and Finnish firms as control group, we find a positive, economically significant effect of enforcement on various CSR report characteristics, including an increase in readability and a reduction in boilerplate disclosures. These reporting effects are larger for firms with low CSR reporting incentives. Moving on to economic effects, we find that the introduction of enforcement effected increases in stock price liquidity and in firms’ CSR activities. These findings indicate that CSR reporting enforcement reduced information asymmetries and triggered real effects. Taken together, our findings suggest that enforcement potentially “works” for CSR reporting. 

Keywords: sustainability reporting, disclosure regulation, enforcement, reporting quality, corporate social responsibility (CSR)
