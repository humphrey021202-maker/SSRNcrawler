Abstract

We provide evidence on how International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers affected the revenue recognition practices of firms in Australia and New Zealand. Firms used the modified retrospective method more than the full retrospective method; however, the usage varied by firm size. The majority of sample firms (63.38%) reported that the standard had either no impact or no material impact on their financial statements; the remaining 36.62% disclosed IFRS 15 impacts in notes to financial statements. The disclosure of impacts varied by sectors and firm size. The standard did not affect the accounting for standard retail sales transactions. However, it resulted in the deferral of revenue recognition for the majority of firms whose revenue recognition was impacted by the standard. For firms that disclosed IFRS 15 impacts on financial statements, revenue was the most affected item. Cost of goods sold, contract liabilities and profit after tax were three other most affected financial statement items. Finally, the standard affected financial statements through multiple channels.
