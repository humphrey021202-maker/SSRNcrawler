Abstract

This study examines how corporate site visits function as an external governance mechanism in emerging markets. Using data from Chinese listed firms (2012–2021), we show that site visits constrain earnings management through enhanced information acquisition and monitoring. Their effectiveness varies by firm-level information asymmetry and agency conflicts, revealing important contextual heterogeneity. We also find evidence of managerial adaptation, with site visits prompting a shift between operational and reporting-based manipulation strategies. These findings offer new insights into how stakeholder engagement can shape corporate behavior, improve transparency, and strengthen governance in markets characterized by weak formal institutions and information frictions.

Keywords: Site visits, Information asymmetry, Institutional monitoring, Managerial behavior, Stakeholder engagement
