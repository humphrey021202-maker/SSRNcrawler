Abstract

This paper explores the extent of IPSAS awareness and determinants in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) emerging market. Data was collected using a survey instrument. This paper uses the multiple regression analysis (OLS) to test the study hypotheses. The results show that respondents' have a moderately high awareness of the IPSAS adoption. The implementation of IPSAS improves the decision-making quality, reporting transparency and efficiency. Respondents indicate low IPSAS adoption costs and support the IPSAS adoption preparation. Besides, IPSAS awareness depends on the perceived benefits of decision-making and reporting quality improvements and organization size. The respondents' work experience, organization service activities and type are vital determinates of the IPSAS benefits. This paper provides useful guidelines for professional accountants, managers and organizations to improve the IPSAS adoption process.
