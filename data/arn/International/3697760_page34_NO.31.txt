Abstract

Firms with higher R&D intensity subsequently experience higher stock returns in international stock markets, highlighting the role of intangible investments in international asset pricing. The R&D effect is stronger in countries where growth option risk is more likely priced, but is unrelated to country characteristics representing market sentiments and limits-of-arbitrage. Moreover, we find that R&D intensity is associated with higher future operating performance, return volatility, and default likelihood. Our evidence suggests that the cross-sectional relation between R&D intensity and stock return is more likely attributable to risk premium than to mispricing.

Keywords: R&D; Cross-section of stock returns; Innovation

JEL Classification: G12, G15, O32
