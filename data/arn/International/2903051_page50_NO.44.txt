Abstract

Value-relevance research is an important domain of modern capital market research. Accounting researchers have used the value-relevance research framework in many ways with the aim of measuring whether accounting information has a predicted association with equity market values. One of the most widely used models in value-relevance research is a modification of the Ohlson (1995) market valuation model in which the market value of a firm’s equity is presumed to be a function of its book value of equity and abnormal earnings. Furthermore, using the Ohlson (1995) model, accounting researchers have documented the value relevance of different types of financial and non-financial information. Drawing on a selected number of recently published studies that have documented the value relevance of different types of financial and non-financial information, this chapter reviews and integrates recent findings, highlighting challenges and providing future directions for further research in this area.

Keywords: Value Relevance, Ohlson Model, Capital Market, Financial Information, Non-financial Information.
