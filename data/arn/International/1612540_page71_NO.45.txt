Abstract

Firms all over the world have been switching auditors at a higher rate recently; therefore the reasons behind these changes have become increasingly important. This paper will focus on the reasons why a company may engage in an auditor switch, and then discuss the reasons for auditor changes in three European countries. These countries will be Malta, Spain and the United Kingdom. Each country will be analyzed to establish what the main cause(s) of auditor switch is in their respective country, and then determine if there is a common theme across the European Union.

Keywords: auditor switching, European auditing, auditor changes

JEL Classification: M41, M40, M49
