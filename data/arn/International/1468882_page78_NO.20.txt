Abstract

The role of the auditor general ranges from accounting to thorough-going analysis of the performance of organisations. In many countries the Auditor-General has reviewed the performance of the telecommunications regulatory authority which provides parliaments and the public with an insight that is not otherwise available. The adoption of this approach in other countries could be beneficial.

Keywords: Audit, Review, Regulation, Telecommunications

JEL Classification: D7, H5, K2, I5, I96, I98
