Should International Accounting Standards Prescribe the Capitalization of Intangible Assets?

Abstract

Balance sheet figures must be reliable and need not necessarily be value relevant. In order to protect the company's creditors, and to safeguard the investing public against the possibility of earnings management, intangible assets should only be recognized when the most stringent of standards are satisfied. According to this line of reasoning, the efforts to make the capitalization of intangibles mandatory appear rather misguided.

Keywords: capitalization, intangibles, balance sheet, intangible assets

JEL Classification: M41, M43, M44
