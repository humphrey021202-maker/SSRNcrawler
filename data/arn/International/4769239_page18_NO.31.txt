Abstract

This study uses an ideal setting to capture the influence of the national institutional environment on outcomes (i.e., earnings quality) of IFRS convergence using a within-country approach. We show that earnings quality in terms of discretionary accruals and persistence has increased, while conservatism has decreased after IFRS convergence. The results are more pronounced in companies with a strong institutional environment. Our results are robust after considering incentives and other confounding factors. Our findings show differences in earnings quality in firms within a country adopting the same standards, let alone in firms worldwide. This indicates the context embeddedness of accounting standards.

Keywords: Earnings quality; IFRS convergence; Institutional environment; Within-country approach

JEL Classification: M41
