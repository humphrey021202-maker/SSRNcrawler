Abstract

Our study investigates the impact of harmonizing accounting standards on firm values, leveraging the quasi-natural experiment of Chinese A-share firms’ mandatory adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in 2007. Using propensity score matching (PSM) with difference-in-differences (DiD) analysis, we provide conclusive evidence that IFRS adoption significantly increases firm values and reduces crash risk, even within the Chinese context. The analysis also highlights the roles of reduced asymmetric information and business risk as key transmission channels driving these effects.

Keywords: information disclosure, accounting standards, market valuation, value relevance, emerging markets, Chinese markets
