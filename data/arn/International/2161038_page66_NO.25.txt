Abstract

We discuss the accounting rules that apply to reporting a U.S. company’s international operations. We use examples to illustrate diversity in accounting and offer caveats for policy makers, standard setters, analysts, and researchers regarding their interpretation and use of financial accounting information.

Keywords: corporate tax, international tax, tax avoidance, book-tax differences, accounting for income taxes

JEL Classification: H25, H26, M41, M48
