Accounting conservatism roomates applied in different levels are influenced by external and internal factors. The external factors used in this study is the adoption of IFRS, while the internal factors are used that good corporate governance mechanisms such as the proportion of independent directors, the intensity of board meetings, managerial ownership, educational background of financial accounting and audit committee members and the size of the company.

This study measured conservatism based on the accrual that was developed by Gipoly and Hyan (2002). The population of this study were manufacturing companies listed on the stock exchange Indonesia in 2005-2012. The sample was 38 manufacturing companies determined by purposive sampling. Data analysis was performed with the classical assumption and hypothesis testing with multiple linear regression models. The results of this study indicate that the IFRS, the intensity of board meetings, and institutional ownership have significant effects on the level of accounting conservatism. On the other hand, the proportion of independent directors, the educational background of financial accounting and audit committee members and the size of the company does not have a significant effect on the level of accounting conservatism after the adoption of IFRS.
