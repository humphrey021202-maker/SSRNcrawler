Abstract

We empirically examine the effect of IFRS adoption on the information quality of financial reporting in low investor protection countries. We examine the capital markets of France, Switzerland and Sweden, three Western European civil law countries, which are regarded as low investor protection, owing primarily to their respective systems of law according to the World Economic Forum’s 2011/2012 Global Competitiveness Report. By utilising and analysing data from 2003 and 2011, we find a significant improvement in both forecast accuracy and forecast dispersion following the mandatory adoption of IFRS in all three of the countries sampled, confirming our hypotheses. These results are robust to an increase in sample size as well as the removal of financial companies from the primary sample. These results suggest that the mandatory adoption of IFRS in low investor protection countries will lead to an improvement in information quality and international comparability.

Keywords: IFRS adoption, mandatory IFRS adoption, investor protection, corporate governance, information quality, forecast accuracy, forecast dispersion

JEL Classification: G14, G30, K22, M41
