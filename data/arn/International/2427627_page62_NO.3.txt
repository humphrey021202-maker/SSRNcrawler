Abstract

The 2007 global financial crisis revealed a deficiency in the financial reporting of off-balance-sheet vehicles. To better reflect risks associated with such items, International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 10 provided new principles for determining an investor’s control of an investee for the purpose of preparing consolidated financial statements. We show that an applicative example appearing under the new guidelines contradicts the conclusion drawn from widely accepted power indices: the Shapley-Shubik value and the Banzhaf index. Our study adds to the literature aiming to incorporate methodological economic thought into accounting principles.

Keywords: IFRS, power index, Shapley-Shubik, Banzhaf, consolidation, financial reporting

JEL Classification: D72, G34, M41
