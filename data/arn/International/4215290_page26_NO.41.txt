Abstract

We introduce NID, a language model based approach to identify semantically new information within financial text. We showcase the performance of our measure by studying the lazy prices anomaly in an international setting using 500,000 annual reports from stocks across the globe. On the one hand, we find that NID identifies novel information with greater accuracy than traditional word-based techniques, generating a 89 bps monthly six-factor alpha. On the other hand, we obtain evidence that the anomaly primarily exists in markets with a strict regulatory oversight and predominantly affects smaller stocks. Notably, the results show no significant difference across low and high transaction costs, implying that limited attention, rather than limits to arbitrage, drives the observed anomaly.



Keywords: Textual Analysis, Value Relevance, Securities Laws, Annual Reports, Disclosure, BERT
