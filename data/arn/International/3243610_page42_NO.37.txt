Abstract

I explore the incidence, amounts, disclosure and potential sources of bargain purchase gains reported by an Australian sample of firms during 2013-15. I find that 7.58% of the acquirers reported bargain purchase gains during this period. The median gain as a percentage of consideration transferred was 18.90%. In contravention of IFRS 3 Business Combinations, not all acquirers with material bargain purchase gains disclosed in notes why the gain arose. The evidence suggests uncertainty about the sources of the gain.

Keywords: Bargain Purchase Gains, Business Combinations, IFRS, Australia

JEL Classification: G34, M41
