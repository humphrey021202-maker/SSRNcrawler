Abstract

Single-owner grantor trusts arise frequently in cross-border settings. Despite some resemblance to wholly-owned disregarded entities, their treatment could differ significantly for federal income tax purposes. In this report, Zhu sorts through some of these differences under the entity classification rules, income source rules, and income characterization rules. Zhu proposes that we expressly abolish the trust residence rules in existence before the 1996 amendments to section 7701(a)(30) and (31) of the code and that we explicitly disregard a single-owner grantor trust for purposes of determining the federal income tax liabilities of its grantor.

Keywords: grantor trusts, income source rules, entity classification, cross-border

JEL Classification: K34, K33
