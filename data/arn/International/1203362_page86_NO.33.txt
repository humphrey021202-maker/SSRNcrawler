Abstract

We provide evidence that a new mutual fund 'international growth' investment style is born between 1986 and 1995. This corresponds to a large increase in the number of equity international growth funds during this period and a greater appetite amongst investors for international investments.

Keywords: Investment Style, US mutual funds, k-means clustering
