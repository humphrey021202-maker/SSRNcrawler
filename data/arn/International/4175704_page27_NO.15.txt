Abstract

Sustainability reporting awareness is increasing worldwide. Extant research examining sustainability reporting has mainly focused on developed economies. With the exception of South Africa, there has not been much progress made in sustainability reporting by firms in African countries. This study examines the trend of voluntary sustainability reporting in Africa and further explores the relationship between sustainability disclosures and financial performance. While the findings do not show any significant improvement in sustainability reporting over the period studied, a positive relationship is observed between sustainability disclosures and measures of financial performance. The results suggest that firms with better financial performance have more disclosures. The findings are useful to the GRI organization in making improvements to the current guidelines and managers seeking to either improve sustainability reporting or implement voluntary sustainability reporting in less developed economies.

Keywords: Global Reporting Initiative; GRI, Africa, Sustainability, Disclosures, Financial Performance
