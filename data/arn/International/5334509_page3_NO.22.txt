Abstract

This study examines how listing status influences earnings management, with a particular focus on the moderating role of stock liquidity. While public listing is typically associated with enhanced market discipline through broader investor access and external monitoring, it can also impose short-term performance pressure, especially in highly liquid markets. Using a large panel of Japanese firms, we find that listed firms are more likely to engage in earnings management than unlisted firms, suggesting that short-term incentives may outweigh the governance benefits of listing. This effect is significantly more pronounced among listed firms with high stock liquidity, supporting the notion that liquidity amplifies market pressure and myopic behavior. Conversely, listed firms with low liquidity exhibit similar behavior to unlisted firms, suggesting that liquidity is a key mechanism through which listing status affects the quality of financial reporting. These findings challenge the conventional view of liquidity as disciplining force, instead pointing to its role as a driver of short-termism in public equity markets.

Keywords: earnings management, listing status, liquidity, stock market pressure, unlisted firms
