Abstract

This study examines whether there is a difference in the degree of conditional and unconditional conservatism between firms that adopt IFRS and those that use Japanese Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (J-GAAP). Although several differences in accounting standards and accounting treatments related to conservatism exist between J-GAAP and IFRS, whether IFRS is more or less conservative is a priori unclear. Our estimated proxies of conditional conservatism are larger for IFRS adopters than for J-GAAP users that have similar corporate governance structures, while those of unconditional conservatism are not significantly different between the two parties.

Keywords: Voluntary IFRS adoption; Conservatism; M&A; corporate governance

JEL Classification: M41; M48
