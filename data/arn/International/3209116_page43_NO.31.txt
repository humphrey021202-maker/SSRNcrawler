Abstract

This paper investigates whether accounting information of firms that voluntarily adopted IFRS provides incremental information to the capital market, using a sample of Japanese listed firms that disclosed reconciling items from Japanese Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (J-GAAP) to International Financial Reports Standards (IFRS) when they transfer from J-GAAP to IFRS for the first time. In details, applying level models, I tested the incremental content of reconciliation from J-GAAP to IFRS for investors interested in J-GAAP- and IFRS-based accounting numbers, respectively. The results show that the reconciliation items do have incremental information for IFRS-based other than J-GAAP-based accounting information users.

Keywords: Ifrs, Voluntary Adoption, Value Relevance, First-Time Adoption, Japan
