Abstract

The actual second Federal Poverty and Richness Report, too, has its focus on the two poles of the income distribution: poverty and richness. For the first time a detailled distributional analysis is presented based on microdata of the German Income Tax Statistics 1992, 1995, 1998 and - based on microsimulation - for 2003. The contribution here for the first time deepens the results for (liberal) professions and entrepreneurs compared to the employees. The development of the high income situation from the 90ties with alternative richness limits is investigated in particular. The special feature of our results is the sound foundation rovided by the microdata of the Income Tax Statistics 1992, 1995, 1998 and simulated 2003. This individual data base with about 12 Mio. of anonymised taxpayers' information is the most sound source with respect of income for the self-employed in particular. Especially for the self-employed as professions and entrepreneurs such sound information was not available up to now.
